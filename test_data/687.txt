Give an example of a linear program for which the feasible region is not bounded, but the
optimal objective value is finite.

29.2 Formulating problems as linear programs
Although we shall focus on the simplex algorithm in this chapter, it is also important to be
able to recognize when a problem can be formulated as a linear program. Once a problem is
formulated as a polynomial-sized linear program, it can be solved in polynomial time by the
ellipsoid or interior-point algorithms. Several linear-programming software packages can
solve problems efficiently, so that once the problem has been expressed as a linear program, it
can be solved in practice by such a package.
We shall look at several concrete examples of linear-programming problems. We start with
two problems that we have already studied: the single-source shortest-paths problem (see
Chapter 24) and the maximum-flow problem (see Chapter 26). We then describe the
minimum-cost-flow problem. There is a polynomial-time algorithm that is not based on linear
programming for the minimum-cost-flow problem, but we shall not examine it. Finally, we
describe the multicommodity-flow problem, for which the only known polynomial-time
algorithm is based on linear programming.
Shortest paths
The single-source shortest-paths problem, described in Chapter 24, can be formulated as a
linear program. In this section, we shall focus on the formulation of the single-pair shortestpath problem, leaving the extension to the more general single-source shortest-paths problem
as Exercise 29.2-3.
