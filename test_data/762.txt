We now show that equation (31.28) ensures that a ≡ ai (mod ni) for i = 1, 2, ..., k. Note that if j
≠ i, then mj ≡ 0 (mod ni), which implies that cj ≡ mj ≡ 0 (mod ni). Note also that ci ≡ 1 (mod
ni), from equation (31.27). We thus have the appealing and useful correspondence
ci ↔ (0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0),
a vector that has 0's everywhere except in the ith coordinate, where it has a 1; the ci thus form
a "basis" for the representation, in a certain sense. For each i, therefore, we have
a ≡ aici
≡ aimi(
≡ ai

(mod ni)
) (mod ni)
(mod ni),

which is what we wished to show: our method of computing a from the ai's produces a result
a that satisfies the constraints a ≡ ai (mod ni) for i = 1, 2, ..., k. The correspondence is one-toone, since we can transform in both directions. Finally, equations (31.24)–(31.26) follow
directly from Exercise 31.1-6, since x mod ni = (x mod n) mod ni for any x and i = 1, 2, ..., k.

The following corollaries will be used later in this chapter.
Corollary 31.28
If n1, n2, ..., nk are pairwise relatively prime and n = n1n2 nk, then for any integers a1, a2, ..., ak,
the set of simultaneous equations
x ≡ ai (mod ni),
for i = 1, 2, ..., k, has a unique solution modulo n for the unknown x.

Corollary 31.29
If n1, n2, ..., nk are pairwise relatively prime and n = n1n2 · · · nk, then for all integers x and a,
x ≡ a (mod ni)
for i = 1, 2, ..., k if and only if
x ≡ a (mod n).
