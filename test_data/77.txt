Letting j = ⌊logb n⌋, we obtain

and thus we see that at depth ⌊logb n⌋, the problem size is at most a constant.
From Figure 4.4, we see that
(4.13)

which is much the same as equation (4.6), except that n is an arbitrary integer and not
restricted to be an exact power of b.
We can now evaluate the summation
(4.14)

from (4.13) in a manner analogous to the proof of Lemma 4.3. Beginning with case 3, if
af(⌈n/b⌉) ≤ cf(n) for n > b + b/(b - 1), where c < 1 is a constant, then it follows that ajf(nj) ≤
cjf(n). Therefore, the sum in equation (4.14) can be evaluated just as in Lemma 4.3. For case
. If we can show that
, then the proof for
2, we have
case 2 of Lemma 4.3 will go through. Observe that j = ≤ ⌊logb n⌋ implies bj/n ≤ 1. The bound
implies that there exists a constant c > 0 such that for all sufficiently large nj,
