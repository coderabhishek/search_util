In order to complete the proof, we need to show that for sufficiently large n, this last
expression is at most cn or, equivalently, that cn/4 - c/2 - an ≥ 0. If we add c/2 to both sides
and factor out n, we get n(c/4 - a) ≥ c/2. As long as we choose the constant c so that c/4 - a >
0, i.e., c > 4a, we can divide both sides by c/4 - a, giving

Thus, if we assume that T(n) = O(1) for n < 2c/(c -4a), we have T(n) = O(n). We conclude that
any order statistic, and in particular the median, can be determined on average in linear time.
