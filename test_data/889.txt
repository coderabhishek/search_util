Problems 34-4: Scheduling with profits and deadlines
Suppose you have one machine and a set of n tasks a1, a2,..., an. Each task aj has a processing
time tj, a profit pj, and a deadline dj. The machine can process only one task at a time, and task
aj must run uninterruptedly for tj consecutive time units. If you complete task aj by its
deadline dj, you receive a profit pj, but if you complete it after its deadline, you receive no
profit. As an optimization problem, you are given the processing times, profits, and deadlines
for a set of n tasks, and you wish to find a schedule that completes all the tasks and returns the
greatest amount of profit.
a. State this problem as a decision problem.
b. Show that the decision problem is NP-complete.
c. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for the decision problem, assuming that all
processing times are integers from 1 to n. (Hint: Use dynamic programming.)
d. Give a polyomial-time algorithm for the optimization problem, assuming that all
processing times are integers from 1 to n.

Technically, we define a cycle in terms of vertices rather than edges (see Section B.4). In
the interest of clarity, we abuse notation here and define the hamiltonian cycle in terms of
edges.

In fact, any base b, where b â‰¥ 7, would work. The instance at the beginning of this
subsection is the set S and target t in Figure 34.19 interpreted in base 7, with S listed in sorted
order.

Chapter notes
The book by Garey and Johnson [110] provides a wonderful guide to NP-completeness,
discussing the theory at length and providing a catalogue of many problems that were known
to be NP-complete in 1979. The proof of Theorem 34.13 is adapted from their book, and the
list of NP-complete problem domains at the beginning of Section 34.5 is drawn from their
table of contents. Johnson wrote a series of 23 columns in the Journal of Algorithms between
1981 and 1992 reporting new developments in NP-completeness. Hopcroft, Motwani, and
Ullman [153], Lewis and Papadimitriou [204], Papadimitiou [236], and Sipser [279] have
good treatments of NP-completeness in the context of complexity theory. Aho, Hopcroft, and
