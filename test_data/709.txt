slack forms, evaluated at , are equal. More generally, the equivalence of all slack forms
implies that for any set of values x = (x1, x2, ..., xn), we have

Therefore, for any set of values x, we have

so that
(29.102)

Applying Lemma 29.3 to equation (29.102), we obtain
(29.103)
(29.104)
By equation (29.103), we have that
, and hence the objective value of the dual
is equal to that of the primal (vâ€²). It remains to show that the solution is feasible for the
dual problem. From (29.97) and (29.98), we have that
for all j = 1, 2, ..., n + m. Hence,
for any i = 1, 2, ..., m, (29.104) implies that
