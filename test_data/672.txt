Find the inverse of A.
Show that for any n × n symmetric positive-definite, tridiagonal matrix A and any nvector b, the equation Ax = b can be solved in O(n) time by performing an LU
decomposition. Argue that any method based on forming A-1 is asymptotically more
expensive in the worst case.
e. Show that for any n × n nonsingular, tridiagonal matrix A and any n-vector b, the
equation Ax = b can be solved in O(n) time by performing an LUP decomposition.

Problems 28-2: Splines
A practical method for interpolating a set of points with a curve is to use cubic splines. We
are given a set {(xi , yi) : i = 0, 1, . . . , n} of n + 1 point-value pairs, where x0 < x1 < · · · < xn.
We wish to fit a piecewise-cubic curve (spline) f(x) to the points. That is, the curve f(x) is
made up of n cubic polynomials fi(x) = ai + bix + cix2 + dix3 for i = 0, 1, . . . , n - 1, where if x
falls in the range xi ≤ x ≤ xi+1, then the value of the curve is given by f(x) = fi(x - xi). The points
xi at which the cubic polynomials are "pasted" together are called knots. For simplicity, we
shall assume that xi = i for i = 0, 1, . . . , n.
To ensure continuity of f(x), we require that
f(xi) = fi(0) = yi,
f(xi+1) = fi(1) = yi+1
for i = 0, 1, . . . , n - 1. To ensure that f(x) is sufficiently smooth, we also insist that there be
continuity of the first derivative at each knot:

for i = 0, 1, . . . , n - 1.
a. Suppose that for i = 0, 1, . . . , n, we are given not only the point-value pairs {(xi, yi)}
but also the first derivatives Di = f'(xi) at each knot. Express each coefficient ai, bi, ci,
and di in terms of the values yi, yi+1, Di, and Di+1. (Remember that xi = i.) How quickly
can the 4n coefficients be computed from the point-value pairs and first derivatives?
The question remains of how to choose the first derivatives of f(x) at the knots. One method is
to require the second derivatives to be continuous at the knots:
