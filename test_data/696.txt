PIVOT works as follows. Lines 2–5 compute the coefficients in the new equation for xe by
rewriting the equation that has xl on the left-hand side to instead have xe on the left-hand side.
Lines 7–11 update the remaining equations by substituting the right-hand side of this new
equation for each occurrence of xe. Lines 13–16 do the same substitution for the objective
function, and lines 18 and 19 update the sets of nonbasic and basic variables. Line 20 returns
the new slack form. As given, if ale = 0, PIVOT would cause an error by dividing by 0, but as
we shall see in the proofs of Lemmas 29.2 and 29.12, PIVOT is called only when ale ≠ 0.
We now summarize the effect that PIVOT has on the values of the variables in the basic
solution.
Lemma 29.1
Consider a call to PIVOT(N, B, A, b, c, v, l, e) in which ale ≠ 0. Let the values returned from
the call be
, and let denote the basic solution after the call. Then

Proof The first statement is true because the basic solution always sets all nonbasic variables
to 0. When we set each nonbasic variable to 0 in a constraint

we have that
