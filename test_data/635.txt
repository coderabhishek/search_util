Such a matrix is called a permutation matrix because multiplying a vector x by a
permutation matrix has the effect of permuting (rearranging) the elements of x.
7. A symmetric matrix A satisfies the condition A = AT. For example,

is a symmetric matrix.
Operations on matrices
The elements of a matrix or vector are numbers from a number system, such as the real
numbers, the complex numbers, or integers modulo a prime. The number system defines how
to add and multiply numbers. We can extend these definitions to encompass addition and
multiplication of matrices.
We define matrix addition as follows. If A = (aij) and B = (bij) are m × n matrices, then their
matrix sum C = (cij) = A + B is the m × n matrix defined by
cij = aij + bij
for i = 1, 2, . . . , m and j = 1, 2, . . . , n. That is, matrix addition is performed componentwise.
A zero matrix is the identity for matrix addition:
A+0=A
= 0 + A.
If λ is a number and A = (aij) is a matrix, then λA = (λaij) is the scalar multiple of A obtained
by multiplying each of its elements by λ. As a special case, we define the negative of a matrix
A = (aij) to be -1 · A = - A, so that the ijth entry of -A is -aij. Thus,
A + (-A) = 0
= (-A) + A.
Given this definition, we can define matrix subtraction as the addition of the negative of a
matrix: A - B = A + (-B).
We define matrix multiplication as follows. We start with two matrices A and B that are
compatible in the sense that the number of columns of A equals the number of rows of B. (In
general, an expression containing a matrix product AB is always assumed to imply that
matrices A and B are compatible.) If A = (aij) is an m × n matrix and B = (bjk) is an n × p
matrix, then their matrix product C = AB is the m × p matrix C = (cik), where
