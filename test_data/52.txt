We also have the following inequalities for x > -1:
(3.16)
where equality holds only for x = 0.
We say that a function f(n) is polylogarithmically bounded if f(n) = O(lgk n) for some
constant k. We can relate the growth of polynomials and polylogarithms by substituting lg n
for n and 2a for a in equation (3.9), yielding

From this limit, we can conclude that
lgb n = o(na)
for any constant a > 0. Thus, any positive polynomial function grows faster than any
polylogarithmic function.
Factorials
The notation n! (read "n factorial") is defined for integers n ≥ 0 as

Thus, n! = 1 · 2 · 3 n.
A weak upper bound on the factorial function is n! ≤ nn, since each of the n terms in the
factorial product is at most n. Stirling's approximation,
(3.17)
where e is the base of the natural logarithm, gives us a tighter upper bound, and a lower bound
as well. One can prove (see Exercise 3.2-3)
(3.18)

where Stirling's approximation is helpful in proving equation (3.18). The following equation
also holds for all n ≥ 1:
