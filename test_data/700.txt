executed, we find that aie ≤ 0. Let x be the basic solution associated with the slack
form at the beginning of the iteration that returned "unbounded." Consider the solution
defined as

We now show that this solution is feasible, i.e., that all variables are nonnegative. The
nonbasic variables other than are 0, and is positive; thus all nonbasic variables are
nonnegative. For each basic variable , we have

The loop invariant implies that bi ≥ 0, and we have aie ≤ 0 and

. Thus,

.

Now we show that the objective value for the solution is unbounded. The objective
value is

Since ce > 0 (by line 3) and
program is unbounded.

, the objective value is ∞, and thus the linear

At each iteration, SIMPLEX maintains A, b, c, and v in addition to the sets N and B. Although
explicitly maintaining A, b, c, and v is essential for the efficient implementation of the
simplex algorithm, it is not strictly necessary. In other words, the slack form is uniquely
determined by the sets of basic and nonbasic variables. Before proving this fact, we prove a
useful algebraic lemma.
Lemma 29.3
Let I be a set of indices. For each i I, let αi and βi be real numbers, and let xi be a realvalued variable. Let γ be any real number. Suppose that for any settings of the xi, we have
(29.81)
Then αi = βi for each i

I, and γ = 0.

Proof Since equation (29.81) holds for any values of the xi, we can use particular values to
draw conclusions about α, β, and γ. If we let xi = 0 for each i I, we conclude that γ = 0. Now
