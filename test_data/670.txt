whose pseudoinverse is

Multiplying y by A+, we obtain the coefficient vector

which corresponds to the quadratic polynomial
F(x) = 1.200 - 0.757x + 0.214x2
as the closest-fitting quadratic to the given data, in a least-squares sense.
As a practical matter, we solve the normal equation (28.33) by multiplying y by AT and then
finding an LU decomposition of AT A. If A has full rank, the matrix AT A is guaranteed to be
nonsingular, because it is symmetric and positive-definite. (See Exercise 28.1-2 and Theorem
28.6.)
Exercises 28.5-1
Prove that every diagonal element of a symmetric positive-definite matrix is positive.

Exercises 28.5-2

Let
be a 2 Ã— 2 symmetric positive-definite matrix. Prove that its determinant ac - b2
is positive by "completing the square" in a manner similar to that used in the proof of Lemma
28.11.

Exercises 28.5-3
Prove that the maximum element in a symmetric positive-definite matrix lies on the diagonal.
