Exercises 34.5-8
In the half 3-CNF satisfiability problem, we are given a 3-CNF formula φ with n variables
and m clauses, where m is even. We wish to determine whether there exists a truth assignment
to the variables of φ such that exactly half the clauses evaluate to 0 and exactly half the
clauses evaluate to 1. Prove that the half 3-CNF satisfiability problem is NP-complete.

Problems 34-1: Independent set
An independent set of a graph G = (V, E) is a subset V' V of vertices such that each edge in
E is incident on at most one vertex in V'. The independent-set problem is to find a maximumsize independent set in G.
a. Formulate a related decision problem for the independent-set problem, and prove that
it is NP-complete. (Hint: Reduce from the clique problem.)
b. Suppose that you are given a "black-box" subroutine to solve the decision problem
you defined in part (a). Give an algorithm to find an independent set of maximum size.
The running time of your algorithm should be polynomial in |V| and |E|, where queries
to the black box are counted as a single step.
Although the independent-set decision problem is NP-complete, certain special cases are
polynomial-time solvable.
c. Give an efficient algorithm to solve the independent-set problem when each vertex in
G has degree 2. Analyze the running time, and prove that your algorithm works
correctly.
d. Give an efficient algorithm to solve the independent-set problem when G is bipartite.
Analyze the running time, and prove that your algorithm works correctly. (Hint: Use
the results of Section 26.3.)

Problems 34-2: Bonnie and Clyde
Bonnie and Clyde have just robbed a bank. They have a bag of money and want to divide it
up. For each of the following scenarios, either give a polynomial-time algorithm, or prove that
the problem is NP-complete. The input in each case is a list of the n items in the bag, along
with the value of each.
a. There are n coins, but only 2 different denominations: some coins are worth x dollars,
and some are worth y dollars. They wish to divide the money exactly evenly.
