(29.95)

Proof By Corollary 29.9, if we can find feasible solutions and that satisfy equation (29.95),
then and must be optimal primal and dual solutions. We shall now show that the solutions
and described in the statement of the theorem satisfy equation (29.95).
Suppose that we run SIMPLEX on a primal linear program, as given in lines (29.16)–(29.18).
The algorithm proceeds through a series of slack forms until it terminates with a final slack
form with objective function
(29.96)
Since SIMPLEX terminated with a solution, by the condition in line 2 we know that
(29.97)
If we define
(29.98)
we can rewrite equation (29.96) as
(29.99)

For the basic solution associated with this final slack form,
for all j N, and z = v′.
Since all slack forms are equivalent, if we evaluate the original objective function on , we
must obtain the same objective value, i.e.,
(29.100)

(29.101)

We shall now show that , defined by equation (29.94), is feasible for the dual linear program
and that its objective value
equals
. Equation (29.100) says that the first and last
