Indicate, for each pair of expressions (A, B) in the table below, whether A is O, o, Ω, ω, or Θ
of B. Assume that k ≥ 1, > 0, and c > 1 are constants. Your answer should be in the form of
the table with "yes" or "no" written in each box.

Problems 3-3: Ordering by asymptotic growth rates
a. Rank the following functions by order of growth; that is, find an arrangement g1, g2,
..., g30 of the functions satisfying g1 = Ω(g2), g2 = Ω(g3), ..., g29 = Ω(g30). Partition your
list into equivalence classes such that f(n) and g(n) are in the same class if and only if
f(n) = Θ(g(n)).

b. Give an example of a single nonnegative function f(n) such that for all functions gi(n)
in part (a), f(n) is neither O(gi(n)) nor Ω(gi(n)).

Problems 3-4: Asymptotic notation properties
Let f(n) and g(n) be asymptotically positive functions. Prove or disprove each of the following
conjectures.
a. f(n) = O(g(n)) implies g(n) = O(f(n)).
b. f(n) + g(n) = Θ(min(f(n), g(n))).
c. f(n) = O(g(n)) implies lg(f(n)) = O(lg(g(n))), where lg(g(n)) ≥ 1 and f(n) ≥ 1 for all
sufficiently large n.
d. f(n) = O(g(n)) implies 2f(n) = O (2g(n)).
e. f(n) = O((f(n))2).
f. f(n) = O(g(n)) implies g(n) = Ω(f(n)).
