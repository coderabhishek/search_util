Figure 3.1(a) gives an intuitive picture of functions f(n) and g(n), where we have that f(n) =
Θ(g(n)). For all values of n to the right of n0, the value of f(n) lies at or above c1g(n) and at or
below c2g(n). In other words, for all n ≥ n0, the function f(n) is equal to g(n) to within a
constant factor. We say that g(n) is an asymptotically tight bound for f(n).

Figure 3.1: Graphic examples of the Θ, O, and Ω notations. In each part, the value of n0
shown is the minimum possible value; any greater value would also work. (a) Θ-notation
bounds a function to within constant factors. We write f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if there exist positive
constants n0, c1, and c2 such that to the right of n0, the value of f(n) always lies between c1g(n)
and c2g(n) inclusive. (b) O-notation gives an upper bound for a function to within a constant
factor. We write f(n) = O(g(n)) if there are positive constants n0 and c such that to the right of
n0, the value of f(n) always lies on or below cg(n). (c) Ω-notation gives a lower bound for a
function to within a constant factor. We write f(n) = Ω(g(n)) if there are positive constants n0
and c such that to the right of n0, the value of f(n) always lies on or above cg(n).
The definition of Θ(g(n)) requires that every member f(n) Θ(g(n)) be asymptotically
nonnegative, that is, that f(n) be nonnegative whenever n is sufficiently large. (An
asymptotically positive function is one that is positive for all sufficiently large n.)
Consequently, the function g(n) itself must be asymptotically nonnegative, or else the set
Θ(g(n)) is empty. We shall therefore assume that every function used within Θ-notation is
asymptotically nonnegative. This assumption holds for the other asymptotic notations defined
in this chapter as well.
In Chapter 2, we introduced an informal notion of Θ-notation that amounted to throwing away
lower-order terms and ignoring the leading coefficient of the highest-order term. Let us
briefly justify this intuition by using the formal definition to show that 1/2n2 - 3n = Θ(n2). To
do so, we must determine positive constants c1, c2, and n0 such that
c1n2 ≤ 1/2n2 - 3n ≤ c2n2
for all n ≥ n0. Dividing by n2 yields
c1 ≤ 1/2 - 3/n ≤ c2.
The right-hand inequality can be made to hold for any value of n ≥ 1 by choosing c2 ≥ 1/2.
Likewise, the left-hand inequality can be made to hold for any value of n ≥ 7 by choosing c1 ≤
1/14. Thus, by choosing c1 = 1/14, c2 = 1/2, and n0 = 7, we can verify that 1/2n2 - 3n = Θ(n2).
Certainly, other choices for the constants exist, but the important thing is that some choice
exists. Note that these constants depend on the function 1/2n2 - 3n; a different function
belonging to Θ(n2) would usually require different constants.
We can also use the formal definition to verify that 6n3 ≠ Θ(n2). Suppose for the purpose of
contradiction that c2 and n0 exist such that 6n3 ≤ c2n2 for all n ≥ n0. But then n ≤ c2/6, which
cannot possibly hold for arbitrarily large n, since c2 is constant.
