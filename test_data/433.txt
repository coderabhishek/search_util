Lemma 21.3
For any integer j ≥ 1, we have A2(j) = 2j+1(j + 1) - 1.
Proof We first use induction on i to show that
. For the inductive step, assume that
that

. For the base case, we have
. Then
. Finally, we note

.

Now we can see how quickly Ak(j) grows by simply examining Ak (1) for levels k = 0, 1, 2, 3,
4. From the definition of A0(k) and the above lemmas, we have A0(1) = 1 + 1 = 2, A1(1) = 2 · 1
+ 1 = 3, and A2(1) = 21+1 · (1 + 1) - 1 = 7. We also have
A3(1) =
= A2(A2(1))
= A2(7)
= 28 · 8 - 1
= 211 - 1
= 2047
and
A4(1) =
= A3(A3(1))
= A3(2047)
=
A2(2047)
= 12048· 2048 - 1
> 22048
= (24)512
= 16512
1080,
which is the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe.
We define the inverse of the function Ak (n), for integer n ≥ 0, by
α(n) = min {k : Ak(1) = n} .
In words, α(n) is the lowest level k for which Ak(1) is at least n. From the above values of
Ak(1), we see that
