Exercises 23.1-5
Let e be a maximum-weight edge on some cycle of G = (V, E). Prove that there is a minimum
spanning tree of G′ = (V, E -{e}) that is also a minimum spanning tree of G. That is, there is a
minimum spanning tree of G that does not include e.

Exercises 23.1-6
Show that a graph has a unique minimum spanning tree if, for every cut of the graph, there is
a unique light edge crossing the cut. Show that the converse is not true by giving a
counterexample.

Exercises 23.1-7
Argue that if all edge weights of a graph are positive, then any subset of edges that connects
all vertices and has minimum total weight must be a tree. Give an example to show that the
same conclusion does not follow if we allow some weights to be nonpositive.

Exercises 23.1-8
Let T be a minimum spanning tree of a graph G, and let L be the sorted list of the edge
weights of T. Show that for any other minimum spanning tree T′ of G, the list L is also the
sorted list of edge weights of T′.

Exercises 23.1-9
Let T be a minimum spanning tree of a graph G = (V, E), and let V′ be a subset of V. Let T′ be
the subgraph of T induced by V′, and let G′ be the subgraph of G induced by V′. Show that if
T′ is connected, then T′ is a minimum spanning tree of G′.
