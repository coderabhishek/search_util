The next lemma shows that the Schur-complement matrices of symmetric positive-definite
matrices are themselves symmetric and positive-definite. This result was used in Theorem
28.8, and its corollary is needed to prove the correctness of LU decomposition for symmetric
positive-definite matrices.
Lemma 28.11: (Schur complement lemma)
If A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix and Ak is a leading k × k submatrix of A, then the
Schur complement of A with respect to Ak is symmetric and positive-definite.
Proof Because A is symmetric, so is the submatrix C. By Exercise 28.1-8, the product
is symmetric, and by Exercise 28.1-1, S is symmetric.
It remains to show that S is positive-definite. Consider the partition of A given in equation
(28.28). For any nonzero vector x, we have xT Ax > 0 by the assumption that A is positivedefinite. Let us break x into two subvectors y and z compatible with Ak and C, respectively.
exists, we have
Because
(28.30)

by matrix magic. (Verify by multiplying through.) This last equation amounts to "completing
the square" of the quadratic form. (See Exercise 28.5-2.)
Since xT Ax > 0 holds for any nonzero x, let us pick any nonzero z and then choose
which causes the first term in equation (28.30) to vanish, leaving

as the value of the expression. For any z ≠ 0, we therefore have zTSz = xTAx > 0, and thus S is
positive-definite.

Corollary 28.12
LU decomposition of a symmetric positive-definite matrix never causes a division by 0.
Proof Let A be a symmetric positive-definite matrix. We shall prove something stronger than
the statement of the corollary: every pivot is strictly positive. The first pivot is a11. Let e1 be
the first unit vector, from which we obtain
. Since the first step of LU
