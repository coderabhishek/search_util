Exercises 13.3-4
Professor Teach is concerned that RB-INSERT-FIXUP might set color[nil[T]] to RED, in
which case the test in line 1 would not cause the loop to terminate when z is the root. Show
that the professor's concern is unfounded by arguing that RB-INSERT-FIXUP never sets
color[nil[T]] to RED.

Exercises 13.3-5
Consider a red-black tree formed by inserting n nodes with RB-INSERT. Argue that if n > 1,
the tree has at least one red node.

Exercises 13.3-6
Suggest how to implement RB-INSERT efficiently if the representation for red-black trees
includes no storage for parent pointers.

Case 2 falls through into case 3, and so these two cases are not mutually exclusive.

13.4 Deletion
Like the other basic operations on an n-node red-black tree, deletion of a node takes time O(lg
n). Deleting a node from a red-black tree is only slightly more complicated than inserting a
node.
The procedure RB-DELETE is a minor modification of the TREE-DELETE procedure
(Section 12.3). After splicing out a node, it calls an auxiliary procedure RB-DELETE-FIXUP
that changes colors and performs rotations to restore the red-black properties.
RB-DELETE(T, z)
1 if left[z] = nil[T] or right[z] = nil[T]
2
then y ← z
3
else y ← TREE-SUCCESSOR(z)
4 if left[y] ≠ nil[T]
5
then x ← left[y]
6
else x ← right[y]
7 p[x] ← p[y]
8 if p[y] = nil[T]
9
then root[T] ← x
10
else if y = left[p[y]]
11
then left[p[y]] ← x
