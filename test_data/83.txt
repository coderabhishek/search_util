the master method. We describe the result of Akra and Bazzi here, which works for
recurrences of the form
(4.15)

where k ≥ 1; all coefficients ai are positive and sum to at least 1; all bi are at least 2; f(n) is
bounded, positive, and nondecreasing; and for all constants c > 1, there exist constants n0, d >
0 such that f(n/c) ≥ df (n) for all n ≥ n0. This method would work on a recurrence such as T(n)
= T(⌊n/3⌋) + T(⌊2n/3⌋) + O(n), for which the master method does not apply. To solve the
recurrence (4.15), we first find the value of p such that
. (Such a p always
exists, and it is unique and positive.) The solution to the recurrence is then

for n′ a sufficiently large constant. The Akra-Bazzi method can be somewhat difficult to use,
but it serves in solving recurrences that model division of the problem into substantially
unequally sized subproblems. The master method is simpler to use, but it applies only when
subproblem sizes are equal.

Chapter 5: Probabilistic Analysis and
Randomized Algorithms
This chapter introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. If you are
unfamiliar with the basics of probability theory, you should read Appendix C, which reviews
this material. Probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms will be revisited several times
throughout this book.

5.1 The hiring problem
Suppose that you need to hire a new office assistant. Your previous attempts at hiring have
been unsuccessful, and you decide to use an employment agency. The employment agency
will send you one candidate each day. You will interview that person and then decide to either
hire that person or not. You must pay the employment agency a small fee to interview an
applicant. To actually hire an applicant is more costly, however, since you must fire your
current office assistant and pay a large hiring fee to the employment agency. You are
committed to having, at all times, the best possible person for the job. Therefore, you decide
that, after interviewing each applicant, if that applicant is better qualified than the current
office assistant, you will fire the current office assistant and hire the new applicant. You are
willing to pay the resulting price of this strategy, but you wish to estimate what that price will
be.
The procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT, given below, expresses this strategy for hiring in
pseudocode. It assumes that the candidates for the office assistant job are numbered 1 through
n. The procedure assumes that you are able to, after interviewing candidate i, determine if
