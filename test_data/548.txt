26.1 Flow networks
In this section, we give a graph-theoretic definition of flow networks, discuss their properties,
and define the maximum-flow problem precisely. We also introduce some helpful notation.
Flow networks and flows
A flow network G = (V, E) is a directed graph in which each edge (u, v)

E has a nonnegative

capacity c(u, v) ≥ 0. If (u, v) ∉ E, we assume that c(u, v) = 0. We distinguish two vertices in a
flow network: a source s and a sink t. For convenience, we assume that every vertex lies on
some path from the source to the sink. That is, for every vertex v V, there is a path
The graph is therefore connected, and |E| ≥ |V | - 1. Figure 26.1 shows an example
of a flow network.
We are now ready to define flows more formally. Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with a
capacity function c. Let s be the source of the network, and let t be the sink. A flow in G is a
real-valued function f : V × V → R that satisfies the following three properties:

Figure 26.1: (a) A flow network G = (V, E) for the Lucky Puck Company's trucking problem.
The Vancouver factory is the source s, and the Winnipeg warehouse is the sink t. Pucks are
shipped through intermediate cities, but only c(u, v) crates per day can go from city u to city v.
Each edge is labeled with its capacity. (b) A flow f in G with value |f| = 19. Only positive
flows are shown. If f (u, v) > 0, edge (u, v) is labeled by f(u, v)/c(u, v). (The slash notation is
used merely to separate the flow and capacity; it does not indicate division.) If f(u, v) ≤ 0,
edge (u, v) is labeled only by its capacity.
Capacity constraint: For all u, v

V, we require f (u, v) ≤ c(u, v).

Skew symmetry: For all u, v

V, we require f (u, v) = - f (v, u).

Flow conservation: For all u

V - {s, t}, we require

The quantity f (u, v), which can be positive, zero, or negative, is called the flow from vertex u
to vertex v. The value of a flow f is defined as
(26.1)
that is, the total flow out of the source. (Here, the |·| notation denotes flow value, not absolute
value or cardinality.) In the maximum-flow problem, we are given a flow network G with
source s and sink t, and we wish to find a flow of maximum value.
