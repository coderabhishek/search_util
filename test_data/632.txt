he also showed how this technique could be used to sort n numbers in O(lg2 n) time. Shortly
afterward, he discovered an O(lg n)-depth bitonic sorter similar to the one presented in
Section 27.3. Knuth attributes the zero-one principle to W. G. Bouricius (1954), who proved it
in the context of decision trees.
For a long time, the question remained open as to whether a sorting network with depth O(lg
n) exists. In 1983, the answer was shown to be a somewhat unsatisfying yes. The AKS sorting
network (named after its developers, Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi [11]) can sort n numbers
in depth O(lg n) using O(n lg n) comparators. Unfortunately, the constants hidden by the Onotation are quite large (many thousands), and thus it cannot be considered practical.

Chapter 28: Matrix Operations
Overview
Operations on matrices are at the heart of scientific computing. Efficient algorithms for
working with matrices are therefore of considerable practical interest. This chapter provides a
brief introduction to matrix theory and matrix operations, emphasizing the problems of
multiplying matrices and solving sets of simultaneous linear equations.
After Section 28.1 introduces basic matrix concepts and notations, Section 28.2 presents
Strassen's surprising algorithm for multiplying two n × n matrices in Θ(nlg 7) = O(n2.81) time.
Section 28.3 shows how to solve a set of linear equations using LUP decompositions. Then,
Section 28.4 explores the close relationship between the problem of multiplying matrices and
the problem of inverting a matrix. Finally, Section 28.5 discusses the important class of
symmetric positive-definite matrices and shows how they can be used to find a least-squares
solution to an overdetermined set of linear equations.
One important issue that arises in practice is numerical stability. Due to the limited precision
of floating-point representations in actual computers, round-off errors in numerical
computations may become amplified over the course of a computation, leading to incorrect
results; such computations are numerically unstable. Although we shall briefly consider
numerical stability on occasion, we do not focus on it in this chapter. We refer the reader to
the excellent book by Golub and Van Loan [125] for a thorough discussion of stability issues.

28.1 Properties of matrices
In this section, we review some basic concepts of matrix theory and some fundamental
properties of matrices, focusing on those that will be needed in later sections.
Matrices and vectors
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. For example,
