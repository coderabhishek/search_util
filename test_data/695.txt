This system has the associated basic solution (33/4, 0, 3/2, 69/4, 0, 0), with objective value
111/4. Now the only way to increase the objective value is to increase x2. The three
constraints give upper bounds of 132, 4, and ∞, respectively. (The upper bound of ∞ from
constraint (29.74) is because as we increase x2, the value of the basic variable x4 increases
also. This constraint, therefore, places no restriction on how much x2 can be increased.) We
increase x2 to 4, and it becomes nonbasic. Then we solve equation (29.73) for x2 and substitute
in the other equations to obtain

At this point, all coefficients in the objective function are negative. As we shall see later in
this chapter, this situation occurs only when we have rewritten the linear program so that the
basic solution is an optimal solution. Thus, for this problem, the solution (8, 4, 0, 18, 0, 0),
with objective value 28, is optimal. We can now return to our original linear program given in
(29.56)–(29.60). The only variables in the original linear program are x1, x2, and x3, and so our
solution is x1 = 8, x2 = 4, and x3 = 0, with objective value (3 · 8) + (1 · 4) + (2 · 0) = 28. Note
that the values of the slack variables in the final solution measure how much slack is in each
inequality. Slack variable x4 is 18, and in inequality (29.57), the left-hand side, with value 8 +
4 + 0 = 12, is 18 less than the right-hand side of 30. Slack variables x5 and x6 are 0 and indeed,
in inequalities (29.58) and (29.59), the left-hand and right-hand sides are equal. Observe also
that even though the coefficients in the original slack form are integral, the coefficients in the
other linear programs are not necessarily integral, and the intermediate solutions are not
necessarily integral. Furthermore, the final solution to a linear program need not be integral; it
is purely coincidental that this example has an integral solution.
Pivoting
We now formalize the procedure for pivoting. The procedure PIVOT takes as input a slack
form, given by the tuple (N, B, A, b, c, v), the index l of the leaving variable xl, and the index e
of the entering variable xe. It returns the tuple
describing the new slack form.
(Recall again that the entries of the matrices A and are actually the negative of the
coefficients that appear in the slack form.)
