Figure 27.1: (a) A comparator with inputs x and y and outputs x' and y'. (b) The same
comparator, drawn as a single vertical line. Inputs x = 7, y = 3 and outputs x' = 3, y' = 7 are
shown.
x' = min(x, y),
y' = max(x, y).
Because the pictorial representation of a comparator in Figure 27.1(a) is too bulky for our
purposes, we shall adopt the convention of drawing comparators as single vertical lines, as
shown in Figure 27.1(b). Inputs appear on the left and outputs on the right, with the smaller
input value appearing on the top output and the larger input value appearing on the bottom
output. We can thus think of a comparator as sorting its two inputs.
We shall assume that each comparator operates in O(1) time. In other words, we assume that
the time between the appearance of the input values x and y and the production of the output
values x' and y' is a constant.
A wire transmits a value from place to place. Wires can connect the output of one comparator
to the input of another, but otherwise they are either network input wires or network output
wires. Throughout this chapter, we shall assume that a comparison network contains n input
wires a1, a2,...,an, through which the values to be sorted enter the network, and n output wires
b1, b2,...,bn, which produce the results computed by the network. Also, we shall speak of the
input sequence a1, a2,...,an and the output sequence b1, b2,...,bn , referring to the values
on the input and output wires. That is, we use the same name for both a wire and the value it
carries. Our intention will always be clear from the context.
Figure 27.2 shows a comparison network, which is a set of comparators interconnected by
wires. We draw a comparison network on n inputs as a collection of n horizontal lines with
comparators stretched vertically. Note that a line does not represent a single wire, but rather a
sequence of distinct wires connecting various comparators. The top line in Figure 27.2, for
example, represents three wires: input wire a1, which connects to an input of comparator A; a
wire connecting the top output of comparator A to an input of comparator C; and output wire
b1, which comes from the top output of comparator C. Each comparator input is connected to
a wire that is either one of the network's n input wires a1, a2,...,an or is connected to the output
of another comparator. Similarly, each comparator output is connected to a wire that is either
one of the network's n output wires b1, b2,...,bn or is connected to the input of another
comparator. The main requirement for interconnecting comparators is that the graph of
interconnections must be acyclic: if we trace a path from the output of a given comparator to
the input of another to an output to an input, etc., the path we trace must never cycle back on
itself and go through the same comparator twice. Thus, as in Figure 27.2, we can draw a
comparison network with network inputs on the left and network outputs on the right; data
move through the network from left to right.
