Problems 12-4: Number of different binary trees
Let bn denote the number of different binary trees with n nodes. In this problem, you will find
a formula for bn, as well as an asymptotic estimate.
a. Show that b0 = 1 and that, for n ≥ 1,

b. Referring to Problem 4-5 for the definition of a generating function, let B(x) be the
generating function

Show that B(x) = xB(x)2 + 1, and hence one way to express B(x) in closed form is

The Taylor expansion of f(x) around the point x = a is given by

where f(k)(x) is the kth derivative of f evaluated at x.
c. Show that

(the nth Catalan number) by using the Taylor expansion of
around x = 0. (If
you wish, instead of using the Taylor expansion, you may use the generalization of the
binomial expansion (C.4) to nonintegral exponents n, where for any real number n and
for any integer k, we interpret to be n(n - 1) (n - k + 1)/k! if k ≥ 0, and 0 otherwise.)
d. Show that

Chapter notes
Knuth [185] contains a good discussion of simple binary search trees as well as many
variations. Binary search trees seem to have been independently discovered by a number of
