Show that a maximum flow in a network G = (V, E) can always be found by a sequence of at
most |E| augmenting paths. (Hint: Determine the paths after finding the maximum flow.)

Exercises 26.2-9
The edge connectivity of an undirected graph is the minimum number k of edges that must be
removed to disconnect the graph. For example, the edge connectivity of a tree is 1, and the
edge connectivity of a cyclic chain of vertices is 2. Show how the edge connectivity of an
undirected graph G = (V, E) can be determined by running a maximum-flow algorithm on at
most |V| flow networks, each having O(V) vertices and O(E) edges.

Exercises 26.2-10
Suppose that a flow network G = (V, E) has symmetric edges, that is, (u, v) E if and only if
(v, u) E. Show that the Edmonds-Karp algorithm terminates after at most |V| |E|/4 iterations.
(Hint: For any edge (u, v), consider how both δ(s, u) and δ(v, t) change between times at
which (u, v) is critical.)

We use square brackets when we treat an identifier-such as f-as a mutable field, and we use
parentheses when we treat it as a function.

The Ford-Fulkerson method might fail to terminate only if edge capacities are irrational
numbers. In practice, however, irrational numbers cannot be stored on finite-precision
computers.

26.3 Maximum bipartite matching
Some combinatorial problems can easily be cast as maximum-flow problems. The multiplesource, multiple-sink maximum-flow problem from Section 26.1 gave us one example. There
are other combinatorial problems that seem on the surface to have little to do with flow
networks, but can in fact be reduced to maximum-flow problems. This section presents one
such problem: finding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph (see Section B.4). In order to
solve this problem, we shall take advantage of an integrality property provided by the FordFulkerson method. We shall also see that the Ford-Fulkerson method can be made to solve the
maximum-bipartite-matching problem on a graph G = (V, E) in O(V E) time.
The maximum-bipartite-matching problem
Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), a matching is a subset of edges M E such that for all
vertices v V, at most one edge of M is incident on v. We say that a vertex v V is matched
by matching M if some edge in M is incident on v; otherwise, v is unmatched. A maximum
