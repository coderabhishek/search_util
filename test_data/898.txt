In spite of the nice approximation ratio provided by Theorem 35.2, APPROX-TSP-TOUR is
usually not the best practical choice for this problem. There are other approximation
algorithms that typically perform much better in practice. See the references at the end of this
chapter.

35.2.2 The general traveling-salesman problem
If we drop the assumption that the cost function c satisfies the triangle inequality, good
approximate tours cannot be found in polynomial time unless P = NP.
Theorem 35.3
If P ≠ NP, then for any constant ρ ≥ 1, there is no polynomial-time approximation algorithm
with approximation ratio ρ for the general traveling-salesman problem.
Proof The proof is by contradiction. Suppose to the contrary that for some number ρ ≥ 1,
there is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm A with approximation ratio ρ. Without
loss of generality, we assume that ρ is an integer, by rounding it up if necessary. We shall then
show how to use A to solve instances of the hamiltonian-cycle problem (defined in Section
34.2) in polynomial time. Since the hamiltonian-cycle problem is NP-complete, by Theorem
34.13, solving it in polynomial time implies that P = NP, by Theorem 34.4.
Let G = (V, E) be an instance of the hamiltonian-cycle problem. We wish to determine
efficiently whether G contains a hamiltonian cycle by making use of the hypothesized
approximation algorithm A. We turn G into an instance of the traveling-salesman problem as
follows. Let G′ = (V, E′) be the complete graph on V ; that is,
E′ = {(u, v) : u, v

V and u ≠ v}.

Assign an integer cost to each edge in E′ as follows:

Representations of G′ and c can be created from a representation of G in time polynomial in
|V | and |E|.
Now, consider the traveling-salesman problem (G′, c). If the original graph G has a
hamiltonian cycle H , then the cost function c assigns to each edge of H a cost of 1, and so
(G′, c) contains a tour of cost |V|. On the other hand, if G does not contain a hamiltonian
cycle, then any tour of G′ must use some edge not in E. But any tour that uses an edge not in
E has a cost of at least
(ρ | V | + 1) + (|V | - 1) = ρ|V | + |V |
> ρ|V |.
