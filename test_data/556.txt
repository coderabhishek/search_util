Observe that the residual network Gf is itself a flow network with capacities given by cf. The
following lemma shows how a flow in a residual network relates to a flow in the original flow
network.
Lemma 26.2
Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with source s and sink t, and let f be a flow in G. Let Gf be
the residual network of G induced by f, and let f' be a flow in Gf. Then the flow sum f + f'
defined by equation (26.4) is a flow in G with value |f + f'| = |f| + |f'|.
Proof We must verify that skew symmetry, the capacity constraints, and flow conservation
are obeyed. For skew symmetry, note that for all u, v V, we have
(f + f')(u, v) = f(u, v) + f'(u, v)
= -f(v, u) - f'(v, u)
= -(f(v, u) + f'(v, u))
= -(f + f')(v, u).
For the capacity constraints, note that f'(u, v) ≤ cf(u, v) for all u, v
therefore,
(f + f')(u, v) = f(u, v) + f'(u, v)
≤ f(u, v) + (c(u, v) - f(u, v))
= c(u, v).
For flow conservation, note that for all u

Finally, we have

V - {s, t}, we have

V. By equation (26.5),
