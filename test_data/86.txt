Show that the assumption that we are always able to determine which candidate is best in line
4 of procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT implies that we know a total order on the ranks of the
candidates.

Exercises 5.1-2:
Describe an implementation of the procedure RANDOM(a, b) that only makes calls to
RANDOM(0, 1). What is the expected running time of your procedure, as a function of a and
b?

Exercises 5.1-3:
Suppose that you want to output 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. At your
disposal is a procedure BIASED-RANDOM, that outputs either 0 or 1. It outputs 1 with some
probability p and 0 with probability 1 - p, where 0 < p < 1, but you do not know what p is.
Give an algorithm that uses BIASED-RANDOM as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased
answer, returning 0 with probability 1/2 and 1 with probability 1/2. What is the expected
running time of your algorithm as a function of p?

5.2 Indicator random variables
In order to analyze many algorithms, including the hiring problem, we will use indicator
random variables. Indicator random variables provide a convenient method for converting
between probabilities and expectations. Suppose we are given a sample space S and an event
A. Then the indicator random variable I {A} associated with event A is defined as
(5.1)
As a simple example, let us determine the expected number of heads that we obtain when
flipping a fair coin. Our sample space is S = {H, T}, and we define a random variable Y which
takes on the values H and T, each with probability 1/2. We can then define an indicator
random variable XH, associated with the coin coming up heads, which we can express as the
event Y = H. This variable counts the number of heads obtained in this flip, and it is 1 if the
coin comes up heads and 0 otherwise. We write

The expected number of heads obtained in one flip of the coin is simply the expected value of
our indicator variable XH:
