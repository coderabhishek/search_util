comparator. The main requirement for interconnecting comparators is that the graph of
interconnections must be acyclic: if we trace a path from the output of a given comparator to
the input of another to an output to an input, etc., the path we trace must never cycle back on
itself and go through the same comparator twice. Thus, as in Figure 27.2, we can draw a
comparison network with network inputs on the left and network outputs on the right; data
move through the network from left to right.

Figure 27.2: (a) A 4-input, 4-output comparison network, which is in fact a sorting network.
At time 0, the input values shown appear on the four input wires. (b) At time 1, the values
shown appear on the outputs of comparators A and B, which are at depth 1. (c) At time 2, the
values shown appear on the outputs of comparators C and D, at depth 2. Output wires b1 and
b4 now have their final values, but output wires b2 and b3 do not. (d) At time 3, the values
shown appear on the outputs of comparator E, at depth 3. Output wires b2 and b3 now have
their final values.
Each comparator produces its output values only when both of its input values are available to
it. In Figure 27.2(a), for example, suppose that the sequence 9, 5, 2, 6 appears on the input
wires at time 0. At time 0, then, only comparators A and B have all their input values
available. Assuming that each comparator requires one time unit to compute its output values,
comparators A and B produce their outputs at time 1; the resulting values are shown in Figure
27.2(b). Note that comparators A and B produce their values at the same time, or "in parallel."
Now, at time 1, comparators C and D, but not E, have all their input values available. One
time unit later, at time 2, they produce their outputs, as shown in Figure 27.2(c). Comparators
C and D operate in parallel as well. The top output of comparator C and the bottom output of
comparator D connect to output wires b1 and b4, respectively, of the comparison network, and
these network output wires therefore carry their final values at time 2. Meanwhile, at time 2,
comparator E has its inputs available, and Figure 27.2(d) shows that it produces its output
values at time 3. These values are carried on network output wires b2 and b3, and the output
sequence 2, 5, 6, 9 is now complete.
Under the assumption that each comparator takes unit time, we can define the "running time"
of a comparison network, that is, the time it takes for all the output wires to receive their
values once the input wires receive theirs. Informally, this time is the largest number of
comparators that any input element can pass through as it travels from an input wire to an
output wire. More formally, we define the depth of a wire as follows. An input wire of a
comparison network has depth 0. Now, if a comparator has two input wires with depths dx and
dy, then its output wires have depth max(dx, dy) + 1. Because there are no cycles of
comparators in a comparison network, the depth of a wire is well defined, and we define the
depth of a comparator to be the depth of its output wires. Figure 27.2 shows comparator
