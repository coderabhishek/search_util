If g is a primitive root of
x ≡ y (mod φ(n)) holds.

, then the equation gx ≡ gy (mod n) holds if and only if the equation

Proof Suppose first that x ≡ y (mod φ(n)). Then, x = y + kφ(n) for some integer k. Therefore,
(mod n)
gx ≡ gy+kφ(n)

Conversely, suppose that gx ≡ gy (mod n). Because the sequence of powers of g generates
every element of g and | g | = φ(n), Corollary 31.18 implies that the sequence of powers
of g is periodic with period φ(n). Therefore, if gx ≡ gy (mod n), then we must have x ≡ y (mod
φ(n)).

Taking discrete logarithms can sometimes simplify reasoning about a modular equation, as
illustrated in the proof of the following theorem.
Theorem 31.34
If p is an odd prime and e ≥ 1, then the equation
(31.30)
has only two solutions, namely x = 1 and x = -1.
Proof Let n = pe. Theorem 31.32 implies that
written

has a primitive root g. Equation (31.30) can be

(31.31)
After noting that indn,g(1) = 0, we observe that Theorem 31.33 implies that equation (31.31) is
equivalent to
(31.32)
To solve this equation for the unknown indn,g(x), we apply the methods of Section 31.4. By
equation (31.19), we have φ(n) = pe(1 - 1/p) = (p - 1)pe-1. Letting d = gcd(2, φ(n)) = gcd(2, (p 1) pe-1) = 2, and noting that d | 0, we find from Theorem 31.24 that equation (31.32) has
exactly d = 2 solutions. Therefore, equation (31.30) has exactly 2 solutions, which are x = 1
and x = -1 by inspection.
