without affecting the correctness or asymptotic performance of the generic push-relabel
algorithm.

Exercises 26.4-7
Let δf (u, v) be the distance (number of edges) from u to v in the residual network Gf. Show
that GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL maintains the properties that h[u] < |V| implies h[u] ≤ δf(u,
t) and that h[u] ≥ |V| implies h[u] -|V| ≤ δf(u, s).

Exercises 26.4-8:
As in the previous exercise, let δf(u, v) be the distance from u to v in the residual network Gf.
Show how the generic push-relabel algorithm can be modified to maintain the property that
h[u] < |V| implies h[u] = δf(u, t) and that h[u] ≥ |V| implies h[u] - |V| = δf(u, s). The total time
that your implementation dedicates to maintaining this property should be O(V E).

Exercise 26.4-9
Show that the number of nonsaturating pushes executed by GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL on
a flow network G = (V, E) is at most 4 |V|2|E| for |V| ≥ 4.

In the literature, a height function is typically called a "distance function," and the height of
a vertex is called a "distance label." We use the term "height" because it is more suggestive of
the intuition behind the algorithm. We retain the use of the term "relabel" to refer to the
operation that increases the height of a vertex. The height of a vertex is related to its distance
from the sink t, as would be found in a breadth-first search of the transpose GT.

The relabel-to-front algorithm

The push-relabel method allows us to apply the basic operations in any order at all. By
choosing the order carefully and managing the network data structure efficiently, however, we
can solve the maximum-flow problem faster than the O(V2E) bound given by Corollary 26.26.
We shall now examine the relabel-to-front algorithm, a push-relabel algorithm whose running
time is O(V3), which is asymptotically at least as good as O(V2E), and better for dense
networks.
The relabel-to-front algorithm maintains a list of the vertices in the network. Beginning at the
front, the algorithm scans the list, repeatedly selecting an over-flowing vertex u and then
