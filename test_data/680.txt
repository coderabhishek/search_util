In standard form, we are given n real numbers c1, c2, ..., cn; m real numbers b1, b2, ..., bm; and
mn real numbers aij for i = 1, 2, ..., m and j = 1, 2, ..., n. We wish to find n real numbers x1, x2,
..., xn that
(29.16)

subject to
(29.17)
(29.18)
Generalizing the terminology we introduced for the two-variable linear program, we call
expression (29.16) the objective function and the n + m inequalities in lines (29.17) and
(29.18) the constraints. The n constraints in line (29.18) are called the nonnegativity
constraints. An arbitrary linear program need not have nonnegativity constraints, but standard
form requires them. Sometimes we find it convenient to express a linear program in a more
compact form. If we create an m × n matrix A = (aij), an m-dimensional vector b = (bi), an ndimensional vector c = (cj), and an n-dimensional vector x = (xj), then we can rewrite the
linear program defined in (29.16)–(29.18) as
(29.19)
subject to
(29.20)
(29.21)
In line (29.19), cTx is the inner product of two vectors. In line (29.20), Ax is a matrix-vector
product, and in line (29.21), x ≥ 0 means that each entry of the vector x must be nonnegative.
We see that we can specify a linear program in standard form by a tuple (A, b, c), and we shall
adopt the convention that A, b, and c always have the dimensions given above.
We now introduce terminology to describe solutions to linear programs. Some of this
terminology was used in the earlier example of a two-variable linear program. We call a
setting of the variables that satisfies all the constraints a feasible solution, whereas a setting
of the variables that fails to satisfy at least one constraint is called an infeasible solution. We
say that a solution has objective value . A feasible solution whose objective value is
maximum over all feasible solutions is an optimal solution, and we call its objective value
the optimal objective value. If a linear program has no feasible solutions, we say that the
linear program is infeasible; otherwise it is feasible. If a linear program has some feasible
solutions but does not have a finite optimal objective value, we say that the linear program is
unbounded. Exercise 29.1-9 asks you to show that a linear program can have a finite optimal
objective value even if the feasible region is not bounded.
