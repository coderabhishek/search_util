Corollary 16.9
Let M = (S,ℓ) be any matroid. If x is an element of S such that x is not an extension of Ø, then
x is not an extension of any independent subset A of S.
Proof This corollary is simply the contrapositive of Lemma 16.8.

Corollary 16.9 says that any element that cannot be used immediately can never be used.
Therefore, GREEDY cannot make an error by passing over any initial elements in S that are
not an extension of Ø, since they can never be used.
Lemma 16.10: Matroids exhibit the optimal-substructure property
Let x be the first element of S chosen by GREEDY for the weighted matroid M = (S,ℓ). The
remaining problem of finding a maximum-weight independent subset containing x reduces to
finding a maximum-weight independent subset of the weighted matroid M′ = (S′,ℓ), where
S′ = {y
ℓ′ = {B

S : {x, y} ℓ},
S - {x} : B {x}

ℓ}, and

the weight function for M′ is the weight function for M, restricted to S′. (We call M′ the
contraction of M by the element x.)
Proof If A is any maximum-weight independent subset of M containing x, then A′ = A - {x} is
an independent subset of M′. Conversely, any independent subset A′ of M′ yields an
independent subset A = A′ {x} of M. Since we have in both cases that w(A) = w(A′) + w(x),
a maximum-weight solution in M containing x yields a maximum-weight solution in M′, and
vice versa.

Theorem 16.11: (Correctness of the greedy algorithm on matroids
If M = (S,ℓ) is a weighted matroid with weight function w, then GREEDY(M, w) returns an
optimal subset.
Proof By Corollary 16.9, any elements that are passed over initially because they are not
extensions of Ø can be forgotten about, since they can never be useful. Once the first element
x is selected, Lemma 16.7 implies that GREEDY does not err by adding x to A, since there
exists an optimal subset containing x. Finally, Lemma 16.10 implies that the remaining
problem is one of finding an optimal subset in the matroid M′ that is the contraction of M by
x. After the procedure GREEDY sets A to {x}, all of its remaining steps can be interpreted as
acting in the matroid M′ = (S′,ℓ′), because B is independent in M′ if and only if B {x} is
independent in M, for all sets B ℓ′. Thus, the subsequent operation of GREEDY will find a
