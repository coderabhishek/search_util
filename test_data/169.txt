Suppose that an algorithm uses only comparisons to find the ith smallest element in a set of n
elements. Show that it can also find the i - 1 smaller elements and the n - i larger elements
without performing any additional comparisons.

Exercises 9.3-5
Suppose that you have a "black-box" worst-case linear-time median subroutine. Give a
simple, linear-time algorithm that solves the selection problem for an arbitrary order statistic.

Exercises 9.3-6
The kth quantiles of an n-element set are the k - 1 order statistics that divide the sorted set into
k equal-sized sets (to within 1). Give an O(n lg k)-time algorithm to list the kth quantiles of a
set.

Exercises 9.3-7
Describe an O(n)-time algorithm that, given a set S of n distinct numbers and a positive
integer k â‰¤ n, determines the k numbers in S that are closest to the median of S.

Exercises 9.3-8
Let X[1 .. n] and Y [1 .. n] be two arrays, each containing n numbers already in sorted order.
Give an O(lg n)-time algorithm to find the median of all 2n elements in arrays X and Y.

Exercises 9.3-9
Professor Olay is consulting for an oil company, which is planning a large pipeline running
east to west through an oil field of n wells. From each well, a spur pipeline is to be connected
directly to the main pipeline along a shortest path (either north or south), as shown in Figure
9.2. Given x- and y-coordinates of the wells, how should the professor pick the optimal
location of the main pipeline (the one that minimizes the total length of the spurs)? Show that
the optimal location can be determined in linear time.
