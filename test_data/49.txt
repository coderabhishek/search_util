Monotonicity
A function f(n) is monotonically increasing if m ≤ n implies f(m) ≤ f(n). Similarly, it is
monotonically decreasing if m ≤ n implies f(m) ≥ f(n). A function f(n) is strictly increasing if
m < n implies f(m) < f(n) and strictly decreasing if m < n implies f(m) > f(n).
Floors and ceilings
For any real number x, we denote the greatest integer less than or equal to x by ⌊x⌋ (read "the
floor of x") and the least integer greater than or equal to x by ⌈x⌉ (read "the ceiling of x"). For
all real x,

For any integer n,
⌈n/2⌉ + ⌊n/2⌋ = n,
and for any real number n ≥ 0 and integers a, b > 0,

The floor function f(x) = ⌊x⌋ is monotonically increasing, as is the ceiling function f(x) = ⌈x⌉.
Modular arithmetic
For any integer a and any positive integer n, the value a mod n is the remainder (or residue)
of the quotient a/n:
(3.8)
Given a well-defined notion of the remainder of one integer when divided by another, it is
convenient to provide special notation to indicate equality of remainders. If (a mod n) = (b
mod n), we write a ≡ b (mod n) and say that a is equivalent to b, modulo n. In other words, a
≡ b (mod n) if a and b have the same remainder when divided by n. Equivalently, a ≡ b (mod
n) if and only if n is a divisor of b - a. We write a ≢ b (mod n) if a is not equivalent to b,
modulo n.
Polynomials
Given a nonnegative integer d, a polynomial in n of degree d is a function p(n) of the form
