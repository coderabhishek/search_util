Given a set of points Q, prove that the pair of points farthest from each other must be vertices
of CH(Q).

Exercise 33.3-4
For a given polygon P and a point q on its boundary, the shadow of q is the set of points r
such that the segment is entirely on the boundary or in the interior of P.

A polygon P is star-shaped if there exists a point p in the interior of P that is in the shadow of
every point on the boundary of P. The set of all such points p is called the kernel of P. (See
Figure 33.10.) Given an n-vertex, star-shaped polygon P specified by its vertices in
counterclockwise order, show how to compute CH(P) in O(n) time.

Figure 33.10: The definition of a star-shaped polygon, for use in Exercise 33.3-4. (a) A starshaped polygon. The segment from point p to any point q on the boundary intersects the
boundary only at q. (b) A non-star-shaped polygon. The shaded region on the left is the
shadow of q, and the shaded region on the right is the shadow of q′. Since these regions are
disjoint, the kernel is empty.
Exercise 33.3-5
In the on-line convex-hull problem, we are given the set Q of n points one point at a time.
After receiving each point, we are to compute the convex hull of the points seen so far.
Obviously, we could run Graham's scan once for each point, with a total running time of O(n2
lg n). Show how to solve the on-line convex-hull problem in a total of O(n2) time.

Exercise 33.3-6: ⋆
Show how to implement the incremental method for computing the convex hull of n points so
that it runs in O(n lg n) time.
