If SIMPLEX fails to terminate in at most

iterations, then it cycles.

Proof By Lemma 29.4, the set B of basic variables uniquely determines a slack form. There
are n + m variables and |B| = m, and therefore there are
ways to choose B. Thus, there are
only
unique slack forms. Therefore, if SIMPLEX runs for more than
iterations, it must
cycle.

Cycling is theoretically possible, but extremely rare. It is avoidable by choosing the entering
and leaving variables somewhat more carefully. One option is to perturb the input slightly so
that it is impossible to have two solutions with the same objective value. A second is to break
ties lexicographically, and a third is to break ties by always choosing the variable with the
smallest index. This last strategy is known as Bland's rule. We omit the proof that these
strategies avoid cycling.
Lemma 29.6
If in lines 3 and 8 of SIMPLEX, ties are always broken by choosing the variable with the
smallest index, then SIMPLEX must terminate.

We conclude this section with the following lemma.
Lemma 29.7
Assuming that INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX returns a slack form for which the basic solution is
feasible, SIMPLEX either reports that a linear program is unbounded, or it terminates with a
feasible solution in at most
iterations.
Proof Lemmas 29.2 and 29.6 show that if INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX returns a slack form for
which the basic solution is feasible, SIMPLEX either reports that a linear program is
unbounded, or it terminates with a feasible solution. By the contra-positive of Lemma 29.5, if
SIMPLEX terminates with a feasible solution, then it terminates in at most
iterations.

Exercises 29.3-1
Complete the proof of Lemma 29.4 by showing that it must be the case that c = c′ and v = v′.
