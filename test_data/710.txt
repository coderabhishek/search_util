which satisfies the constraints (29.87) of the dual. Finally, since
when we set according to equation (29.94), we have that each
constraints are satisfied as well.

for each j N B,
, and so the nonnegativity

We have shown that, given a feasible linear program, if INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX returns a
feasible solution, and if SIMPLEX terminates without returning "unbounded," then the
solution returned is indeed an optimal solution. We have also shown how to construct an
optimal solution to the dual linear program.
Exercises 29.4-1
Formulate the dual of the linear program given in Exercise 29.3-4.

Exercises 29.4-2
Suppose that we have a linear program that is not in standard form. We could produce the
dual by first converting it to standard form, and then taking the dual. It would be more
convenient, however, to be able to produce the dual directly. Explain how, given an arbitrary
linear program, we can directly take the dual of that linear program.

Exercises 29.4-3
Write down the dual of the maximum-flow linear program, as given in lines (29.47)–(29.50).
Explain how to interpret this formulation as a minimum-cut problem.

Exercises 29.4-4
Write down the dual of the minimum-cost-flow linear program, as given in lines (29.51)–
(29.55). Explain how to interpret this problem in terms of graphs and flows.
