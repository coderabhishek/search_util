or, equivalently, letting A = (aij), x = (xi), and b = (bi), as
(28.17)
If A is nonsingular, it possesses an inverse A-1, and
(28.18)
is the solution vector. We can prove that x is the unique solution to equation (28.17) as
follows. If there are two solutions, x and x′, then Ax = Ax′ = b and
x = (A-1A)x
= A-1(Ax)
= A-1(Ax′)
= (A-1A)x′
= x′.
In this section, we shall be concerned predominantly with the case in which A is nonsingular
or, equivalently (by Theorem 28.1), the rank of A is equal to the number n of unknowns.
There are other possibilities, however, which merit a brief discussion. If the number of
equations is less than the number n of unknowns—or, more generally, if the rank of A is less
than n—then the system is underdetermined. An underdetermined system typically has
infinitely many solutions, although it may have no solutions at all if the equations are
inconsistent. If the number of equations exceeds the number n of unknowns, the system is
overdetermined, and there may not exist any solutions. Finding good approximate solutions to
overdetermined systems of linear equations is an important problem that is addressed in
Section 28.5.
Let us return to our problem of solving the system Ax = b of n equations in n unknowns. One
approach is to compute A-1 and then multiply both sides by A-1, yielding A-1 Ax = A-1b, or x =
A-1b. This approach suffers in practice from numerical instability. There is, fortunately,
another approach—LUP decomposition—that is numerically stable and has the further
advantage of being faster in practice.
Overview of LUP decomposition
The idea behind LUP decomposition is to find three n × n matrices L, U, and P such that
