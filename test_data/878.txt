was chosen arbitrarily from Ē, every edge of Ē is covered by a vertex in V - V'. Hence, the set
V - V', which has size |V | - k, forms a vertex cover for .
Conversely, suppose that has a vertex cover V' V, where |V'| = |V| - k. Then, for all u, v
V, if (u, v) Ē, then u V' or v V' or both. The contrapositive of this implication is that for
all u, v V, if u ∉ V' and v ∉ V', then (u, v) E. In other words, V -V' is a clique, and it has size
|V |-|V'| = k.

Since VERTEX-COVER is NP-complete, we don't expect to find a polynomial-time
algorithm for finding a minimum-size vertex cover. Section 35.1 presents a polynomial-time
"approximation algorithm," however, which produces "approximate" solutions for the vertexcover problem. The size of a vertex cover produced by the algorithm is at most twice the
minimum size of a vertex cover.
Thus, we shouldn't give up hope just because a problem is NP-complete. There may be a
polynomial-time approximation algorithm that obtains near-optimal solutions, even though
finding an optimal solution is NP-complete. Chapter 35 gives several approximation
algorithms for NP-complete problems.

34.5.3 The hamiltonian-cycle problem
We now return to the hamiltonian-cycle problem defined in Section 34.2.
Theorem 34.13
The hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete.
Proof We first show that HAM-CYCLE belongs to NP. Given a graph G = (V, E), our
certificate is the sequence of |V| vertices that makes up the hamiltonian cycle. The verification
algorithm checks that this sequence contains each vertex in V exactly once and that with the
first vertex repeated at the end, it forms a cycle in G. That is, it checks that there is an edge
between each pair of consecutive vertices and between the first and last vertices. This
verification can be performed in polynomial time.
We now prove that VERTEX-COVER ≤P HAM-CYCLE, which shows that HAM-CYCLE is
NP-complete. Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and an integer k, we construct an
undirected graph G' = (V', E') that has a hamiltonian cycle if and only if G has a vertex cover
of size k.
Our construction is based on a widget, which is a piece of a graph that enforces certain
properties. Figure 34.16(a) shows the widget we use. For each edge (u, v) E, the graph G'
that we construct will contain one copy of this widget,which we denote by Wuv. We denote
each vertex in Wuv by [u, v, i] or [v, u, i], where 1 ≤ i ≤ 6, so that each widget Wuv contains 12
vertices. Widget Wuv also contains the 14 edges shown in Figure 34.16(a).
