Exercises 29-3: Integer linear programming
An integer linear-programming problem is a linear-programming problem with the
additional constraint that the variables x must take on integral values. Exercise 34.5-3 shows
that just determining whether an integer linear program has a feasible solution is NP-hard,
which means that there is unlikely to be a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem.
a. Show that weak duality (Lemma 29.8) holds for an integer linear program.
b. Show that duality (Theorem 29.10) does not always hold for an integer linear program.
c. Given a primal linear program in standard form, let us define P to be the optimal
objective value for the primal linear program, D to be the optimal objective value for
its dual, IP to be the optimal objective value for the integer version of the primal (that
is, the primal with the added constraint that the variables take on integer values), and
ID to be the optimal objective value for the integer version of the dual. Show that
IP ≤ P = D ≤ ID.

Exercises 29-4: Farkas's lemma
Let A be an m × n matrix and b be an m-vector. Then Farkas's lemma states that exactly one of
the systems
Ax ≤ 0,
bx > 0
and
yA = b,
y≥ 0
is solvable, where x is an n-vector and y is an m-vector. Prove Farkas's lemma.

Chapter notes
This chapter only begins to study the wide field of linear programming. A number of books
are devoted exclusively to linear programming, including those by Chv´tal [62], Gass [111],
Karloff [171], Schrijver [266], and Vanderbei [304]. Many other books give a good coverage
of linear programming, including those by Papadimitriou and Steiglitz [237] and Ahuja,
