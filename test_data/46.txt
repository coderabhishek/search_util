ω(g(n)) = {f(n): for any positive constant c > 0, there exists a constant n0 > 0 such that 0 ≤
cg(n) < f(n) for all n ≥ n0}.
For example, n2/2 = ω(n), but n2/2 ≠ ω(n2). The relation f(n) = ω(g(n)) implies that

if the limit exists. That is, f(n) becomes arbitrarily large relative to g(n) as n approaches
infinity.
Comparison of functions
Many of the relational properties of real numbers apply to asymptotic comparisons as well.
For the following, assume that f(n) and g(n) are asymptotically positive.
Transitivity:
•

f(n) = Θ(g(n)) and g(n) = Θ(h(n)) imply f(n) = Θ(h(n)),
f(n) = O(g(n)) and g(n) = O(h(n)) imply f(n) = O(h(n)),
f(n) = Ω(g(n)) and g(n) = Ω(h(n)) imply f(n) = Ω(h(n)),
f(n) = o(g(n)) and g(n) = o(h(n)) imply f(n) = o(h(n)),
f(n) = ω(g(n)) and g(n) = ω(h(n)) imply f(n) = ω(h(n)).
Reflexivity:
•

f(n) = Θ(f(n)),
f(n) = O(f(n)),
f(n) = Ω(f(n)).
Symmetry:
f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if and only if g(n) = Θ(f(n)).
Transpose symmetry:
•

f(n) = O(g(n)) if and only if g(n) = Ω(f(n)),
f(n) = o(g(n)) if and only if g(n) = ω(f(n)).
Because these properties hold for asymptotic notations, one can draw an analogy between the
asymptotic comparison of two functions f and g and the comparison of two real numbers a
and b:
