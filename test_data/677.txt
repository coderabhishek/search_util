In order to describe properties of and algorithms for linear programs, it is convenient to have
canonical forms in which to express them. We shall use two forms, standard and slack, in this
chapter. They will be defined precisely in Section 29.1. Informally, a linear program in
standard form is the maximization of a linear function subject to linear inequalities, whereas a
linear program in slack form is the maximization of a linear function subject to linear
equalities. We shall typically use standard form for expressing linear programs, but it is more
convenient to use slack form when we describe the details of the simplex algorithm. For now,
we restrict our attention to maximizing a linear function on n variables subject to a set of m
linear inequalities.
Let us first consider the following linear program with two variables:
(29.11)
subject to
(29.12)
(29.13)
(29.14)
(29.15)
We call any setting of the variables x1 and x2 that satisfies all the constraints (29.12)-(29.15) a
feasible solution to the linear program. If we graph the constraints in the (x1, x2)-Cartesian
coordinate system, as in Figure 29.2(a), we see that the set of feasible solutions (shaded in the
figure) forms a convex region[1] in the two-dimensional space. We call this convex region the
feasible region. The function we wish to maximize is called the objective function.
Conceptually, we could evaluate the objective function x1 + x2 at each point in the feasible
region; we call the value of the objective function at a particular point the objective value. We
could then identify a point that has the maximum objective value as an optimal solution. For
this example (and for most linear programs), the feasible region contains an infinite number of
points, and so we wish to determine an efficient way to find a point that achieves the
maximum objective value without explicitly evaluating the objective function at every point
in the feasible region.

Figure 29.2: (a) The linear program given in (29.12)-(29.15). Each constraint is represented
by a line and a direction. The intersection of the constraints, which is the feasible region, is
shaded. (b) The dotted lines show, respectively, the points for which the objective value is 0,
