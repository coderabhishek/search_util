By plugging in various values for k, we can calculate the expected number of streaks of length
k. If this number is large (much greater than 1), then many streaks of length k are expected to
occur and the probability that one occurs is high. If this number is small (much less than 1),
then very few streaks of length k are expected to occur and the probability that one occurs is
low. If k = c lg n, for some positive constant c, we obtain

If c is large, the expected number of streaks of length c lg n is very small, and we conclude
that they are unlikely to occur. On the other hand, if c < 1/2, then we obtain E [X] = Θ(1/n1/2-1)
= Θ(n1/2), and we expect that there will be a large number of streaks of length (1/2) lg n.
Therefore, one streak of such a length is very likely to occur. From these rough estimates
alone, we can conclude that the length of the longest streak is Θ(lg n).

5.4.4 The on-line hiring problem
As a final example, we consider a variant of the hiring problem. Suppose now that we do not
wish to interview all the candidates in order to find the best one. We also do not wish to hire
and fire as we find better and better applicants. Instead, we are willing to settle for a candidate
who is close to the best, in exchange for hiring exactly once. We must obey one company
requirement: after each interview we must either immediately offer the position to the
applicant or must tell them that they will not receive the job. What is the trade-off between
minimizing the amount of interviewing and maximizing the quality of the candidate hired?
We can model this problem in the following way. After meeting an applicant, we are able to
give each one a score; let score(i) denote the score given to the ith applicant, and assume that
no two applicants receive the same score. After we have seen j applicants, we know which of
the j has the highest score, but we do not know if any of the remaining n - j applicants will
have a higher score. We decide to adopt the strategy of selecting a positive integer k < n,
interviewing and then rejecting the first k applicants, and hiring the first applicant thereafter
who has a higher score than all preceding applicants. If it turns out that the best-qualified
