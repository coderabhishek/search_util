of recurrences and assume that T (n) is constant for small n. For example, we normally state
recurrence (4.1) as
(4.3)
without explicitly giving values for small n. The reason is that although changing the value of
T (1) changes the solution to the recurrence, the solution typically doesn't change by more
than a constant factor, so the order of growth is unchanged.
When we state and solve recurrences, we often omit floors, ceilings, and boundary conditions.
We forge ahead without these details and later determine whether or not they matter. They
usually don't, but it is important to know when they do. Experience helps, and so do some
theorems stating that these details don't affect the asymptotic bounds of many recurrences
encountered in the analysis of algorithms (see Theorem 4.1). In this chapter, however, we
shall address some of these details to show the fine points of recurrence solution methods.

4.1 The substitution method
The substitution method for solving recurrences entails two steps:
1. Guess the form of the solution.
2. Use mathematical induction to find the constants and show that the solution works.
The name comes from the substitution of the guessed answer for the function when the
inductive hypothesis is applied to smaller values. This method is powerful, but it obviously
can be applied only in cases when it is easy to guess the form of the answer.
The substitution method can be used to establish either upper or lower bounds on a
recurrence. As an example, let us determine an upper bound on the recurrence
(4.4)
which is similar to recurrences (4.2) and (4.3). We guess that the solution is T (n) = O(n lg n).
Our method is to prove that T (n) ≤ cn lg n for an appropriate choice of the constant c > 0. We
start by assuming that this bound holds for ⌊n/2⌋, that is, that T (⌊n/2⌋) ≤ c ⌊n/2⌋ lg(⌊n/2⌋).
Substituting into the recurrence yields
T(n) ≤ 2(c ⌊n/2⌋lg(⌊n/2⌋)) + n
≤ cn lg(n/2) + n
= cn lg n - cn lg 2 + n
= cn lg n - cn + n
≤ cn lg n,
where the last step holds as long as c ≥ 1.
Mathematical induction now requires us to show that our solution holds for the boundary
conditions. Typically, we do so by showing that the boundary conditions are suitable as base
cases for the inductive proof. For the recurrence (4.4), we must show that we can choose the
