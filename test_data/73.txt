can then be bounded asymptotically for exact powers of b as follows.
1. If
for some constant > 0, then
.
2. If
, then
.
3. If af (n/b) ≤ cf(n) for some constant c < 1 and for all n ≥ b, then g(n) = Θ(f(n)).
Proof For case 1, we have
Substituting into equation (4.7) yields

, which implies that

.

(4.8)

We bound the summation within the O-notation by factoring out terms and simplifying, which
leaves an increasing geometric series:

Since b and are constants, we can rewrite the last expression as
Substituting this expression for the summation in equation (4.8) yields

.

and case 1 is proved.
Under the assumption that
for case 2, we have that
Substituting into equation (4.7) yields

.

(4.9)

We bound the summation within the Θ as in case 1, but this time we do not obtain a geometric
series. Instead, we discover that every term of the summation is the same:
