Exercises 5.2-2
In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is
the probability that you will hire exactly twice?

Exercises 5.2-3
Use indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of n dice.

Exercises 5.2-4
Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem, which is known as the hatcheck problem. Each of n customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a restaurant. The hatcheck person gives the hats back to the customers in a random order. What is the expected
number of customers that get back their own hat?

Exercises 5.2-5
Let A[1 .. n] be an array of n distinct numbers. If i < j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair (i, j) is
called an inversion of A. (See Problem 2-4 for more on inversions.) Suppose that each
element of A is chosen randomly, independently, and uniformly from the range 1 through n.
Use indicator random variables to compute the expected number of inversions.

5.3 Randomized algorithms
In the previous section, we showed how knowing a distribution on the inputs can help us to
analyze the average-case behavior of an algorithm. Many times, we do not have such
knowledge and no average-case analysis is possible. As mentioned in Section 5.1, we may be
able to use a randomized algorithm.
For a problem such as the hiring problem, in which it is helpful to assume that all
permutations of the input are equally likely, a probabilistic analysis will guide the
development of a randomized algorithm. Instead of assuming a distribution of inputs, we
impose a distribution. In particular, before running the algorithm, we randomly permute the
candidates in order to enforce the property that every permutation is equally likely. This
modification does not change our expectation of hiring a new office assistant roughly ln n
times. It means, however, that for any input we expect this to be the case, rather than for
inputs drawn from a particular distribution.
