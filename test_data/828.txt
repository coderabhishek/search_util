have the same polar angle relative to p0, all but the farthest such point are convex
combinations of p0 and the farthest point, and so we remove them entirely from consideration.
We let m denote the number of points other than p0 that remain. The polar angle, measured in
radians, of each point in Q relative to p0 is in the half-open interval [0, Ï€). Since the points are
sorted according to polar angles, they are sorted in counterclockwise order relative to p0. We
designate this sorted sequence of points by p1, p2, ..., pm . Note that points p1 and pm are
vertices of CH(Q) (see Exercise 33.3-1). Figure 33.7(a) shows the points of Figure 33.6
sequentially numbered in order of increasing polar angle relative to p0.
