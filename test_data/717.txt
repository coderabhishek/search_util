Suppose that we are given a linear program L in standard form, and suppose that for both L
and the dual of L, the basic solutions associated with the initial slack forms are feasible. Show
that the optimal objective value of L is 0.

Exercises 29.5-4
Suppose that we allow strict inequalities in a linear program. Show that in this case, the
