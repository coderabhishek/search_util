a. Prove that an array is Monge if and only if for all i = 1, 2, …, m - 1 and j = 1, 2,…, n 1, we have
A[i, j] + A[i + 1, j + 1] ≤ A[i, j + 1] + A[i + 1, j].
Note (For the "only if" part, use induction separately on rows and columns.)
b. The following array is not Monge. Change one element in order to make it Monge.
(Hint: Use part (a).)
37 23 22 32
21 6 7 10
53 34 30 31
32 13 9 6
43 21 15 8
c. Let f(i) be the index of the column containing the leftmost minimum element of row i.
Prove that f(1) ≤ f(2) ≤ ··· ≤ f(m) for any m × n Monge array.
d. Here is a description of a divide-and-conquer algorithm that computes the left-most
minimum element in each row of an m × n Monge array A:
o Construct a submatrix A′ of A consisting of the even-numbered rows of A.
Recursively determine the leftmost minimum for each row of A′. Then
compute the leftmost minimum in the odd-numbered rows of A.
Explain how to compute the leftmost minimum in the odd-numbered rows of A (given
that the leftmost minimum of the even-numbered rows is known) in O(m + n) time.
e. Write the recurrence describing the running time of the algorithm described in part (d).
Show that its solution is O(m + n log m).

VLSI stands for "very large scale integration," which is the integrated-circuit chip
technology used to fabricate most microprocessors today.

Chapter notes
Recurrences were studied as early as 1202 by L. Fibonacci, for whom the Fibonacci numbers
are named. A. De Moivre introduced the method of generating functions (see Problem 4-5)
for solving recurrences. The master method is adapted from Bentley, Haken, and Saxe [41],
which provides the extended method justified by Exercise 4.4-2. Knuth [182] and Liu [205]
show how to solve linear recurrences using the method of generating functions. Purdom and
Brown [252] and Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik [132] contain extended discussions of
recurrence solving.
Several researchers, including Akra and Bazzi [13], Roura [262], and Verma [306], have
given methods for solving more general divide-and-conquer recurrences than are solved by
