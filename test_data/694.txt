can increase x1. We will, therefore, switch the roles of x1 and x6. We solve equation (29.64)
for x1 and obtain
(29.65)
To rewrite the other equations with x6 on the right-hand side, we substitute for x1 using
equation (29.65). Doing so for equation (29.62), we obtain
(29.66)

Similarly, we can combine equation (29.65) with constraint (29.63) and with objective
function (29.61) to rewrite our linear program in the following form:
(29.67)
(29.68)
(29.69)
(29.70)
We call this operation a pivot. As demonstrated above, a pivot chooses a nonbasic variable xe,
called the entering variable, and a basic variable xl, called the leaving variable, and
exchanges their roles.
The linear program described in (29.67)–(29.70) is equivalent to the linear program described
in equations (29.61)–(29.64). The operations we perform in the simplex algorithm are
rewriting equations so that variables move between the left-hand side and the right-hand side,
and substituting one equation into another. The first operation trivially creates an equivalent
problem, and the second, by elementary linear algebra, also creates an equivalent problem.
To demonstrate this equivalence, observe that our original basic solution (0, 0, 0, 30, 24, 36)
satisfies the new equations (29.68)–(29.70) and has objective value 27 + (1/4) · 0 + (1/2) · 0 (3/4) · 36 = 0. The basic solution associated with the new linear program sets the nonbasic
values to 0 and is (9, 0, 0, 21, 6, 0), with objective value z = 27. Simple arithmetic verifies
that this solution also satisfies equations (29.62)–(29.64) and, when plugged into objective
function (29.61), has objective value (3 · 9) + (1 · 0) + (2 · 0) = 27.
Continuing the example, we wish to find a new variable whose value we wish to increase. We
do not want to increase x6, since as its value increases, the objective value decreases. We can
attempt to increase either x2 or x3; we will choose x3. How far can we increase x3 without
violating any of the constraints? Constraint (29.68) limits it to 18, constraint (29.69) limits it
to 42/5, and constraint (29.70) limits it to 3/2. The third constraint is again the tightest one,
and we will therefore rewrite the third constraint so that x3 is on the left-hand side and x5 is on
the right-hand side. We then substitute this new equation into equations (29.67)–(29.69) and
obtain the new, but equivalent, system
