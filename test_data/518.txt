Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w : E → R, let s V be a
source vertex, and let
be a shortest path in G for some vertices u, v V . Suppose
that G is initialized by INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s) and then a sequence of
relaxation steps that includes the call RELAX(u, v, w) is executed on the edges of G. If d[u] =
δ(s, u) at any time prior to the call, then d[v] = δ(s, v) at all times after the call.
Proof By the upper-bound property, if d[u] = δ(s, u) at some point prior to relaxing edge (u,
v), then this equality holds thereafter. In particular, after relaxing edge (u, v), we have
d[v] ≤ d[u] + w(u, v) (by Lemma 24.13)
= δ(s, u) + w(u, v)
= δ(s, v)
(by Lemma 24.1).
By the upper-bound property, d[v] ≥ δ(s, v), from which we conclude that d[v] = δ(s, v), and
this equality is maintained thereafter.

Lemma 24.15: (Path-relaxation property)
Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w : E → R, and let s V
be a source vertex. Consider any shortest path p = v0, v1, ..., vk from s = v0 to vk. If G is
initialized by INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s) and then a sequence of relaxation steps
occurs that includes, in order, relaxations of edges (v0, v1), (v1, v2),..., (vk-1, vk), then d[vk] =
δ(s, vk) after these relaxations and at all times afterward. This property holds no matter what
other edge relaxations occur, including relaxations that are intermixed with relaxations of the
edges of p.
Proof We show by induction that after the ith edge of path p is relaxed, we have d[vi] = δ(s,
vi). For the basis, i = 0, and before any edges of p have been relaxed, we have from the
initialization that d[v0] = d[s] = 0 = δ(s, s). By the upper-bound property, the value of d[s]
never changes after initialization.
For the inductive step, we assume that d[vi-1] = δ(s, vi-1), and we examine the relaxation of
edge (vi-1, vi). By the convergence property, after this relaxation, we have d[vi] = δ(s, vi), and
this equality is maintained at all times thereafter.

Relaxation and shortest-paths trees
We now show that once a sequence of relaxations has caused the shortest-path estimates to
converge to shortest-path weights, the predecessor subgraph Gπ induced by the resulting π
values is a shortest-paths tree for G. We start with the following lemma, which shows that the
predecessor subgraph always forms a rooted tree whose root is the source.
