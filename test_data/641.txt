Let A be a nonsingular n × n matrix with complex entries. Show that every entry of A-1 is real
if and only if every entry of A is real.

Exercises 28.1-8
Show that if A is a nonsingular, symmetric, n × n matrix, then A-1 is symmetric. Show that if B
is an arbitrary m × n matrix, then the m × m matrix given by the product B ABT is symmetric.

Exercises 28.1-9
Prove Theorem 28.2. That is, show that a matrix A has full column rank if and only if Ax = 0
implies x = 0. (Hint: Express the linear dependence of one column on the others as a matrixvector equation.)

Exercises 28.1-10
Prove that for any two compatible matrices A and B,
rank(AB) ≤ min(rank(A), rank(B)),
where equality holds if either A or B is a nonsingular square matrix. (Hint: Use the alternate
definition of the rank of a matrix.)

Exercises 28.1-11
Given numbers x0, x1, . . . , xn-1, prove that the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix

is
