Given a set Q of points in the plane, we define the convex layers of Q inductively. The first
convex layer of Q consists of those points in Q that are vertices of CH(Q). For i > 1, define Qi
to consist of the points of Q with all points in convex layers 1, 2, ..., i - 1 removed. Then, the
ith convex layer of Q is CH(Qi) if Qi ≠ Ø and is undefined otherwise.
a. Give an O(n2)-time algorithm to find the convex layers of a set of n points.
b. Prove that Ω(n lg n) time is required to compute the convex layers of a set of n points
with any model of computation that requires Ω(n lg n) time to sort n real numbers.

Problems 33-2: Maximal layers
Let Q be a set of n points in the plane. We say that point (x, y) dominates point (x′, y′) if x = x′
and y = y′. A point in Q that is dominated by no other points in Q is said to be maximal. Note
that Q may contain many maximal points, which can be organized into maximal layers as
follows. The first maximal layer L1 is the set of maximal points of Q. For i > 1, the ith
maximal layer Li is the set of maximal points in
.
Suppose that Q has k nonempty maximal layers, and let yi be the y-coordinate of the leftmost
point in Li for i = 1, 2, ..., k. For now, assume that no two points in Q have the same x- or ycoordinate.
a. Show that y1 > y2 > ···> yk.
Consider a point (x, y) that is to the left of any point in Q and for which y is distinct from the
y-coordinate of any point in Q. Let Q′ = Q {(x, y)}.
b. Let j be the minimum index such that yj < y, unless y < yk, in which case we let j = k +
1. Show that the maximal layers of Q′ are as follows.
o If j ≤ k, then the maximal layers of Q′ are the same as the maximal layers of Q,
except that Lj also includes (x, y) as its new leftmost point.
o If j = k + 1, then the first k maximal layers of Q′ are the same as for Q, but in
addition, Q′ has a nonempty (k + 1)st maximal layer: Lk+1 = {(x, y)}.
c. Describe an O(n lg n)-time algorithm to compute the maximal layers of a set Q of n
points. (Hint: Move a sweep line from right to left.)
d. Do any difficulties arise if we now allow input points to have the same x- or ycoordinate? Suggest a way to resolve such problems.

Problems 33-3: Ghostbusters and ghosts
A group of n Ghostbusters is battling n ghosts. Each Ghostbuster is armed with a proton pack,
which shoots a stream at a ghost, eradicating it. A stream goes in a straight line and terminates
when it hits the ghost. The Ghostbusters decide upon the following strategy. They will pair off
with the ghosts, forming n Ghostbuster-ghost pairs, and then simultaneously each Ghostbuster
