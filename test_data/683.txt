Finally, we negate constraint (29.23). For consistency in variable names, we rename to x2
and to x3, obtaining the standard form

Converting linear programs into slack form
To efficiently solve a linear program with the simplex algorithm, we prefer to express it in a
form in which some of the constraints are equality constraints. More precisely, we shall
convert it into a form in which the nonnegativity constraints are the only inequality
constraints, and the remaining constraints are equalities. Let
(29.29)

be an inequality constraint. We introduce a new variable s and rewrite inequality (29.29) as
the two constraints
(29.30)
(29.31)
We call s a slack variable because it measures the slack, or difference, between the left-hand
and right-hand sides of equation (29.29). Because inequality (29.29) is true if and only if both
equation (29.30) and inequality (29.31) are true, we can apply this conversion to each
inequality constraint of a linear program, obtaining an equivalent linear program in which the
only inequality constraints are the nonnegativity constraints. When converting from standard
to slack form, we shall use xn+i (instead of s) to denote the slack variable associated with the
ith inequality. The ith constraint is therefore
(29.32)

along with the nonnegativity constraint xn+i â‰¥ 0.
