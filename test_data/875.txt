Proof To show that CLIQUE NP, for a given graph G = (V, E), we use the set V' V of
vertices in the clique as a certificate for G. Checking whether V' is a clique can be
accomplished in polynomial time by checking whether, for each pair u, v V', the edge (u, v)
belongs to E.
We next prove that 3-CNF-SAT ≤P CLIQUE, which shows that the clique problem is NPhard. That we should be able to prove this result is somewhat surprising, since on the surface
logical formulas seem to have little to do with graphs.
The reduction algorithm begins with an instance of 3-CNF-SAT. Let φ = C1 C2 ··· Ck
be a boolean formula in 3-CNF with k clauses. For r = 1, 2,..., k, each clause Cr has exactly
three distinct literals , and . We shall construct a graph G such that φ is satisfiable if and
only if G has a clique of size k.
The graph G = (V, E) is constructed as follows. For each clause
in φ, we place a
triple of vertices , , and into V. We put an edge between two vertices and if both of the
following hold:
•
•

, and and are in different triples, that is, r ≠ s, and
their corresponding literals are consistent, that is, is not the negation of .

This graph can easily be computed from φ in polynomial time. As an example of this
construction, if we have
φ = (x1

¬x2

¬x3)

(¬x1

x2

x3 )

(x1

x2

x3),

then G is the graph shown in Figure 34.14.

Figure 34.14: The graph G derived from the 3-CNF formula φ = C1 C2 C3, where C1 =
(x1 ¬x2 ¬x3), C2 = (¬x1 x2 x3), and C3 = (x1 x2 x3), in reducing 3-CNF-SAT to
CLIQUE. A satisfying assignment of the formula has x2 = 0, x3 = 1, and x1 may be either 0 or
1. This assignment satisfies C1 with ¬x2, and it satisfies C2 and C3 with x3, corresponding to
the clique with lightly shaded vertices.
We must show that this transformation of φ into G is a reduction. First, suppose that φ has a
satisfying assignment. Then each clause Cr contains at least one literal that is assigned 1, and
each such literal corresponds to a vertex . Picking one such "true" literal from each clause
yields a set V' of k vertices. We claim that V' is a clique. For any two vertices ,
where r
≠ s, both corresponding literals and are mapped to 1 by the given satisfying assignment, and
thus the literals cannot be complements. Thus, by the construction of G, the edge
belongs
to E.
