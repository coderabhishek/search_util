Changing variables
Sometimes, a little algebraic manipulation can make an unknown recurrence similar to one
you have seen before. As an example, consider the recurrence

which looks difficult. We can simplify this recurrence, though, with a change of variables. For
convenience, we shall not worry about rounding off values, such as , to be integers.
Renaming m = lg n yields
T (2m) = 2T (2m/2) + m.
We can now rename S(m) = T(2m) to produce the new recurrence
S(m) = 2S(m/2) + m,
which is very much like recurrence (4.4). Indeed, this new recurrence has the same solution:
S(m) = O(m lg m). Changing back from S(m) to T (n), we obtain T (n) = T (2m) = S(m) = O(m
lg m) = O(lg n lg lg n).
Exercises 4.1-1

Show that the solution of T (n) = T (⌈n/2⌉) + 1 is O(lg n).

Exercises 4.1-2

We saw that the solution of T (n) = 2T (⌊n/2⌋) + n is O(n lg n). Show that the solution of this
recurrence is also Ω(n lg n). Conclude that the solution is Θ(n lg n).

Exercises 4.1-3
Show that by making a different inductive hypothesis, we can overcome the difficulty with
the boundary condition T (1) = 1 for the recurrence (4.4) without adjusting the boundary
conditions for the inductive proof.

Exercises 4.1-4
Show that Θ(n lg n) is the solution to the "exact" recurrence (4.2) for merge sort.
