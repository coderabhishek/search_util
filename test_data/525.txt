Problems 24-5: Karp's minimum mean-weight cycle algorithm
Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph with weight function w : E → R, and let n = |V |. We define
the mean weight of a cycle c = e1, e2,..., ek of edges in E to be

Let µ* = minc µ(c), where c ranges over all directed cycles in G. A cycle c for which µ(c) = µ*
is called a minimum mean-weight cycle. This problem investigates an efficient algorithm for
computing µ*.
Assume without loss of generality that every vertex v V is reachable from a source vertex s
V . Let δ(s, v) be the weight of a shortest path from s to v, and let δk(s, v) be the weight of a
shortest path from s to v consisting of exactly k edges. If there is no path from s to v with
exactly k edges, then δk(s, v) = ∞.
a. Show that if µ*= 0, then G contains no negative-weight cycles and δ(s, v) = min0≤k≤n-1
δk(s, v) for all vertices v V.
b. Show that if µ* = 0, then

V. (Hint: Use both properties from part (a).)
