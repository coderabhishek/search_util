Write pseudocode for BINOMIAL-HEAP-MERGE.

Exercises 19.2-2
Show the binomial heap that results when a node with key 24 is inserted into the binomial
heap shown in Figure 19.7(d).

Exercises 19.2-3
Show the binomial heap that results when the node with key 28 is deleted from the binomial
heap shown in Figure 19.8(c).

Exercises 19.2-4
Argue the correctness of BINOMIAL-HEAP-UNION using the following loop invariant:
•

•

At the start of each iteration of the while loop of lines 9-21, x points to a root that is
one of the following:
o the only root of its degree,
o the first of the only two roots of its degree, or
o the first or second of the only three roots of its degree.
Moreover, all roots preceding x's predecessor on the root list have unique degrees on
the root list, and if x's predecessor has a degree different from that of x, its degree on
the root list is unique, too. Finally, node degrees monotonically increase as we traverse
the root list.

Exercises 19.2-5
Explain why the BINOMIAL-HEAP-MINIMUM procedure might not work correctly if keys
can have the value ∞. Rewrite the pseudocode to make it work correctly in such cases.

Exercises 19.2-6
Suppose there is no way to represent the key -∞. Rewrite the BINOMIAL-HEAP-DELETE
procedure to work correctly in this situation. It should still take O(lg n) time.
