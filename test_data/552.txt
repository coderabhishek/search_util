Lemma 26.1
Let G = (V, E) be a flow network, and let f be a flow in G. Then the following equalities hold:
1. For all X V, we have f(X, X) = 0.
2. For all X, Y V, we have f(X, Y) = - f (Y, X).
3. For all X, Y, Z V with X ∩ Y = Ø, we have the sums f(X
f(X, Z) + f(Y, Z) and f(Z, X

Y, Z) =

Y) = f (Z, X) + f(Z, Y).

As an example of working with the implicit summation notation, we can prove that the value
of a flow is the total flow into the sink; that is,
(26.3)
Intuitively, we expect this property to hold. By flow conservation, all vertices other than the
source and sink have equal amounts of total positive flow entering and leaving. The source
has, by definition, a total net flow that is greater than 0; that is, more positive flow leaves the
source than enters it. Symmetrically, the sink is the only vertex that can have a total net flow
that is less than 0; that is, more positive flow enters the sink than leaves it. Our formal proof
goes as follows:
|f| = f(s, V)
(by definition)
= f(V, V) - f (V - s, V) (by Lemma 26.1, part (3))
= - f(V - s, V)
(by Lemma 26.1, part (1))
(by Lemma 26.1, part (2))
= f(V, V - s)
= f(V, t) + f(V, V - s - t) (by Lemma 26.1, part (3))
(by flow conservation).
= f(V, t)
Later in this chapter, we shall generalize this result (Lemma 26.5).
Exercises 26.1-1

Using the definition of a flow, prove that if (u, v) ∉ E and (v, u) ∉ E then f(u, v) = f(v, u) = 0.

Exercises 26.1-2
Prove that for any vertex v other than the source or sink, the total positive flow entering v
must equal the total positive flow leaving v.
