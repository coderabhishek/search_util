(30.4)

The matrix on the left is denoted V (x0, x1,..., xn-1) and is known as a Vander-monde matrix.
By Exercise 28.1-11, this matrix has determinant

and therefore, by Theorem 28.5, it is invertible (that is, nonsingular) if the xk are distinct.
Thus, the coefficients aj can be solved for uniquely given the point-value representation:
a = V (x0, x1,..., xn-1)-1 y.

The proof of Theorem 30.1 describes an algorithm for interpolation based on solving the set
(30.4) of linear equations. Using the LU decomposition algorithms of Chapter 28, we can
solve these equations in time O(n3).
A faster algorithm for n-point interpolation is based on Lagrange's formula:
(30.5)

You may wish to verify that the right-hand side of equation (30.5) is a polynomial of degreebound n that satisfies A(xi) = yi for all i. Exercise 30.1-5 asks you how to compute the
coefficients of A using Lagrange's formula in time Θ(n2).
Thus, n-point evaluation and interpolation are well-defined inverse operations that transform
between the coefficient representation of a polynomial and a point-value representation.[1] The
algorithms described above for these problems take time Θ(n2).
The point-value representation is quite convenient for many operations on polynomials. For
addition, if C(x) = A(x) + B(x), then C(xk) = A(xk) + B(xk) for any point xk. More precisely, if
we have a point-value representation for A,
{(x0, y0), (x1, y1),..., (xn-1, yn-1)},
and for B,

(note that A and B are evaluated at the same n points), then a point-value representation for C
is
