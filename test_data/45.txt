We interpret such equations using the following rule: No matter how the anonymous functions
are chosen on the left of the equal sign, there is a way to choose the anonymous functions on
the right of the equal sign to make the equation valid. Thus, the meaning of our example is
that for any function f(n) Θ(n), there is some function g(n) Θ(n2) such that 2n2 + f(n) =
g(n) for all n. In other words, the right-hand side of an equation provides a coarser level of
detail than the left-hand side.
A number of such relationships can be chained together, as in
2n2 + 3n + 1 = 2n2 + Θ(n)
= Θ(n2).
We can interpret each equation separately by the rule above. The first equation says that there
is some function f(n) Θ(n) such that 2n2 + 3n + 1 = 2n2 + f(n) for all n. The second equation
says that for any function g(n) Θ(n) (such as the f(n) just mentioned), there is some function
h(n) Θ(n2) such that 2n2 + g(n) = h(n) for all n. Note that this interpretation implies that 2n2
+ 3n + 1 = Θ(n2), which is what the chaining of equations intuitively gives us.
o-notation
The asymptotic upper bound provided by O-notation may or may not be asymptotically tight.
The bound 2n2 = O(n2) is asymptotically tight, but the bound 2n = O(n2) is not. We use onotation to denote an upper bound that is not asymptotically tight. We formally define o(g(n))
("little-oh of g of n") as the set
o(g(n)) = {f(n) : for any positive constant c > 0, there exists a constant n0 > 0 such that 0 ≤ f(n)
< cg(n) for all n ≥ n0}.
For example, 2n = o(n2), but 2n2 ≠ o(n2).
The definitions of O-notation and o-notation are similar. The main difference is that in f(n) =
O(g(n)), the bound 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) holds for some constant c > 0, but in f(n) = o(g(n)), the
bound 0 ≤ f(n) < cg(n) holds for all constants c > 0. Intuitively, in the o-notation, the function
f(n) becomes insignificant relative to g(n) as n approaches infinity; that is,
(3.1)
Some authors use this limit as a definition of the o-notation; the definition in this book also
restricts the anonymous functions to be asymptotically nonnegative.
ω-notation
By analogy, ω-notation is to Ω-notation as o-notation is to O-notation. We use ω-notation to
denote a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight. One way to define it is by
f(n)

ω(g(n)) if and only if g(n)

o(f(n)).

Formally, however, we define ω(g(n)) ("little-omega of g of n") as the set
