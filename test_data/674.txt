Another important matrix decomposition is the singular value decomposition, or SVD. In the
SVD, an m × n matrix A is factored into
, where Σ is an m × n matrix with nonzero
values only on the diagonal, Q1 is m × m with mutually orthonormal columns, and Q2 is n × n,
also with mutually orthonormal columns. Two vectors are orthonormal if their inner product
is 0 and each vector has a norm of 1. The books by Strang [285, 286] and Golub and Van
Loan [125] contain good treatments of the SVD.
Strang [286] has an excellent presentation of symmetric positive-definite matrices and of
linear algebra in general.

Chapter 29: Linear Programming
Many problems can be formulated as maximizing or minimizing an objective, given limited
resources and competing constraints. If we can specify the objective as a linear function of
certain variables, and if we can specify the constraints on resources as equalities or
inequalities on those variables, then we have a linear-programming problem. Linear
programs arise in a variety of practical applications. We begin by studying an application in
electoral politics.
A political problem
Suppose that you are a politician trying to win an election. Your district has three different
types of areas-urban, suburban, and rural. These areas have, respectively, 100,000, 200,000,
and 50,000 registered voters. To govern effectively, you would like to win a majority of the
votes in each of the three regions. You are honorable and would never consider supporting
policies in which you do not believe. You realize, however, that certain issues may be more
effective in winning votes in certain places. Your primary issues are building more roads, gun
control, farm subsidies, and a gasoline tax dedicated to improved public transit. According to
your campaign staff's research, you can estimate how many votes you win or lose from each
population segment by spending $1,000 on advertising on each issue. This information
appears in the table of Figure 29.1. In this table, each entry describes the number of thousands
of either urban, suburban, or rural voters who could be won over by spending $1,000 on
advertising in support of a particular issue. Negative entries denote votes that would be lost.
Your task is to figure out the minimum amount of money that you need to spend in order to
win 50,000 urban votes, 100,000 suburban votes, and 25,000 rural votes.
