Problems 26-3: Space shuttle experiments
Professor Spock is consulting for NASA, which is planning a series of space shuttle flights
and must decide which commercial experiments to perform and which instruments to have on
board each flight. For each flight, NASA considers a set E = {E1, E2, . . . ,Em} of experiments,
and the commercial sponsor of experiment Ej has agreed to pay NASA pj dollars for the
results of the experiment. The experiments use a set I = {I1, I2, . . . ,In} of instruments; each
experiment Ej requires all the instruments in a subset Rj I. The cost of carrying instrument Ik
is ck dollars. The professor's job is to find an efficient algorithm to determine which
experiments to perform and which instruments to carry for a given flight in order to maximize
the net revenue, which is the total income from experiments performed minus the total cost of
all instruments carried.
Consider the following network G. The network contains a source vertex s, vertices I1, I2, . . .
,In, vertices E1, E2, . . . ,Em, and a sink vertex t. For k = 1, 2. . . ,n, there is an edge (s, Ik) of
capacity ck, and for j = 1, 2,. . . ,m, there is an edge (Ej, t) of capacity pj. For k = 1, 2, . . . ,n
and j = 1, 2, . . . ,m, if Ik Rj , then there is an edge (Ik, Ej) of infinite capacity.
a. Show that if Ej T for a finite-capacity cut (S, T) of G, then Ik T for each Ik Rj.
b. Show how to determine the maximum net revenue from the capacity of the minimum
cut of G and the given pj values.
c. Give an efficient algorithm to determine which experiments to perform and which
instruments to carry. Analyze the running time of your algorithm in terms of m, n, and
.

Problem 26-4: Updating maximum flow
Let G = (V,E) be a flow network with source s, sink t, and integer capacities. Suppose that we
are given a maximum flow in G.
a. Suppose that the capacity of a single edge (u, v)
E)-time algorithm to update the maximum flow.
b. Suppose that the capacity of a single edge (u, v)
E)-time algorithm to update the maximum flow.

E is increased by 1. Give an O(V +
E is decreased by 1. Give an O(V +

Problem 26-5: Maximum flow by scaling
Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with source s, sink t, and an integer capacity c(u, v) on each
edge (u, v) E. Let C = max(u, v) Ec(u, v).
a. Argue that a minimum cut of G has capacity at most C |E|.
