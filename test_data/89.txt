E[Xi] = Pr {candidate i is hired},
and we must therefore compute the probability that lines 5-6 of HIRE-ASSISTANT are
executed.
Candidate i is hired, in line 5, exactly when candidate i is better than each of candidates 1
through i - 1. Because we have assumed that the candidates arrive in a random order, the first
i candidates have appeared in a random order. Any one of these first i candidates is equally
likely to be the best-qualified so far. Candidate i has a probability of 1/i of being better
qualified than candidates 1 through i - 1 and thus a probability of 1/i of being hired. By
Lemma 5.1, we conclude that
(5.4)
Now we can compute E[X]:
(5.5)

(5.6)

Even though we interview n people, we only actually hire approximately ln n of them, on
average. We summarize this result in the following lemma.
Lemma 5.2
Assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, algorithm HIRE-ASSISTANT
has a total hiring cost of O(ch ln n).
Proof The bound follows immediately from our definition of the hiring cost and equation
(5.6).

The expected interview cost is a significant improvement over the worst-case hiring cost of
O(nch).
Exercises 5.2-1
In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is
the probability that you will hire exactly one time? What is the probability that you will hire
exactly n times?
