29.4 Duality
We have proven that, under certain assumptions, SIMPLEX will terminate. We have not yet
shown that it actually finds the optimal solution to a linear program, however. In order to do
so, we introduce a powerful concept called linear-programming duality.
Duality is a very important property. In an optimization problem, the identification of a dual
problem is almost always coupled with the discovery of a polynomial-time algorithm. Duality
is also powerful in its ability to provide a proof that a solution is indeed optimal.
For example, suppose that, given an instance of a maximum-flow problem, we find a flow f of
value |f|. How do we know whether f is a maximum flow? By the max-flow min-cut theorem
(Theorem 26.7), if we can find a cut whose value is also |f|, then we have verified that f is
indeed a maximum flow. This is an example of duality: given a maximization problem, we
define a related minimization problem such that the two problems have the same optimal
objective values.
Given a linear program in which the objective is to maximize, we shall describe how to
formulate a dual linear program in which the objective is to minimize and whose optimal
value is identical to that of the original linear program. When referring to dual linear
programs, we call the original linear program the primal.
Given a primal linear program in standard form, as in (29.16)–(29.18), we define the dual
linear program as
minimize

subject to
(29.87)
(29.88)
To form the dual, we change the maximization to a minimization, exchange the roles of the
right-hand sides and the objective-function coefficients, and replace the less-than-or-equal-to
by a greater-than-or-equal-to. Each of the m constraints in the primal has an associated
variable yi in the dual, and each of the n constraints in the dual has an associated variable xj in
