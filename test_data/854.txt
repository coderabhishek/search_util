complement. That is, does L NP imply
We can define the complexity class co-NP as
the set of languages L such that
. The question of whether NP is closed under
complement can be rephrased as whether NP = co-NP. Since P is closed under complement
(Exercise 34.1-6), it follows that P NP co-NP. Once again, however, it is not known
whether P = NP co-NP or whether there is some language in NP co-NP -P. Figure 34.3
shows the four possible scenarios.

Figure 34.3: Four possibilities for relationships among complexity classes. In each diagram,
one region enclosing another indicates a proper-subset relation. (a) P = NP = co-NP. Most
researchers regard this possibility as the most unlikely. (b) If NP is closed under complement,
then NP = co-NP, but it need not be the case that P = NP. (c) P = NP co-NP, but NP is not
closed under complement. (d) NP ≠ co-NP and P ≠ NP co-NP. Most researchers regard this
possibility as the most likely.
Thus, our understanding of the precise relationship between P and NP is woefully incomplete.
Nevertheless, by exploring the theory of NP-completeness, we shall find that our
disadvantage in proving problems to be intractable is, from a practical point of view, not
nearly so great as we might suppose.
Exercises 34.2-1
Consider the language GRAPH-ISOMORPHISM = { G1, G2 : G1 and G2 are isomorphic
graphs}. Prove that GRAPH-ISOMORPHISM NP by describing a polynomial-time
algorithm to verify the language.

Exercises 34.2-2
Prove that if G is an undirected bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices, then G is
nonhamiltonian.
