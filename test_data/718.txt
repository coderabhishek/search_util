Problems 29-1: Linear-inequality feasibility
Given a set of m linear inequalities on n variables x1, x2, ..., xn, the linear-inequality feasibility
problem asks if there is a setting of the variables that simultaneously satisfies each of the
inequalities.
a. Show that if we have an algorithm for linear programming, we can use it to solve the
linear-inequality feasibility problem. The number of variables and constraints that you
use in the linear-programming problem should be polynomial in n and m.
b. Show that if we have an algorithm for the linear-inequality feasibility problem, we can
use it to solve a linear-programming problem. The number of variables and linear
inequalities that you use in the linear-inequality feasibility problem should be
polynomial in n and m, the number of variables and constraints in the linear program.

Problems 29-2: Complementary slackness
Complementary slackness describes a relationship between the values of primal variables and
dual constraints and between the values of dual variables and primal constraints. Let be an
optimal solution to a primal linear program given in (29.16)–(29.18), and let be the optimal
solution to the dual linear program given in (29.86)–(29.88). Complementary slackness states
that the following conditions are necessary and sufficient for and to be optimal:

and

a. Verify that complementary slackness holds for the linear program in lines (29.56)–
(29.60).
b. Prove that complementary slackness holds for any primal linear program and its
corresponding dual.
c. Prove that a feasible solution to a primal linear program given in lines (29.16)–
(29.18) is optimal if and only if there are values
such that
1. is a feasible solution to the dual linear program given in (29.86)–(29.88),
