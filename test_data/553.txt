Exercises 26.1-3
Extend the flow properties and definitions to the multiple-source, multiple-sink problem.
Show that any flow in a multiple-source, multiple-sink flow network corresponds to a flow of
identical value in the single-source, single-sink network obtained by adding a supersource and
a supersink, and vice versa.

Exercises 26.1-4
Prove Lemma 26.1.

Exercises 26.1-5
For the flow network G = (V, E) and flow f shown in Figure 26.1(b), find a pair of subsets X,
Y V for which f(X, Y) = - f(V - X, Y). Then, find a pair of subsets X, Y V for which f (X, Y)
≠ - f(V - X, Y).

Exercises 26.1-6
Given a flow network G = (V, E), let f1 and f2 be functions from V × V to R. The flow sum f1 +
f2 is the function from V × V to R defined by
(26.4)
for all u, v V. If f1 and f2 are flows in G, which of the three flow properties must the flow
sum f1 + f2 satisfy, and which might it violate?

Exercises 26.1-7
Let f be a flow in a network, and let α be a real number. The scalar flow product, denoted α f,
is a function from V × V to R defined by
(αf)(u, v) = α · f (u, v).
