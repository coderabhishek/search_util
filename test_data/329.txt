to find an optimal solution to this variant of the knapsack problem, and argue that your
algorithm is correct.

Exercises 16.2-4
Professor Midas drives an automobile from Newark to Reno along Interstate 80. His car's gas
tank, when full, holds enough gas to travel n miles, and his map gives the distances between
gas stations on his route. The professor wishes to make as few gas stops as possible along the
way. Give an efficient method by which Professor Midas can determine at which gas stations
he should stop, and prove that your strategy yields an optimal solution.

Exercises 16.2-5
Describe an efficient algorithm that, given a set {x1, x2, ...,xn} of points on the real line,
determines the smallest set of unit-length closed intervals that contains all of the given points.
Argue that your algorithm is correct.

Exercises 16.2-6:
Show how to solve the fractional knapsack problem in O(n) time. Assume that you have a
solution to Problem 9-2.

Exercises 16.2-7
Suppose you are given two sets A and B, each containing n positive integers. You can choose
to reorder each set however you like. After reordering, let ai be the ith element of set A, and
. Give an algorithm that
let bi be the ith element of set B. You then receive a payoff of
will maximize your payoff. Prove that your algorithm maximizes the payoff, and state its
running time.

16.3 Huffman codes
Huffman codes are a widely used and very effective technique for compressing data; savings
of 20% to 90% are typical, depending on the characteristics of the data being compressed. We
consider the data to be a sequence of characters. Huffman's greedy algorithm uses a table of
the frequencies of occurrence of the characters to build up an optimal way of representing
each character as a binary string.
