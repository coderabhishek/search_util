For the basis, d[v] ≥ δ(s, v) is certainly true after initialization, since d[s] = 0 ≥ δ(s, s) (note
that δ(s, s) is -∞ if s is on a negative-weight cycle and 0 otherwise) and d[v] = ∞ implies d[v]
≥ δ(s, v) for all v V - {s}.
For the inductive step, consider the relaxation of an edge (u, v). By the inductive hypothesis,
d[x] ≥ δ(s, x) for all x V prior to the relaxation. The only d value that may change is d[v]. If
it changes, we have and so the invariant is maintained.
d[v] = d[u] + w(u, v)
≥ δ(s, u) + w(u, v) (by inductive hypothesis)
≥ δ(s, v)
(by the triangle inequality).
To see that the value of d[v] never changes once d[v] = δ(s, v), note that having achieved its
lower bound, d[v] cannot decrease because we have just shown that d[v] ≥ δ(s, v), and it
cannot increase because relaxation steps do not increase d values.

Corollary 24.12: (No-path property)
Suppose that in a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E) with weight function w : E → R, no
path connects a source vertex s V to a given vertex v V. Then, after the graph is
initialized by INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s), we have d[v] = δ(s, v) = ∞, and this
equality is maintained as an invariant over any sequence of relaxation steps on the edges of G.
Proof By the upper-bound property, we always have ∞ = δ(s, v) ≤ d[v], and thus d[v] = ∞ =
δ(s, v).

Lemma 24.13
Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w : E → R, and let (u, v)
E. Then, immediately after relaxing edge (u, v) by executing RELAX(u, v, w), we have d[v] ≤
d[u] + w(u, v).
Proof If, just prior to relaxing edge (u, v), we have d[v] > d[u] + w(u, v), then d[v] = d[u] +
w(u, v) afterward. If, instead, d[v] ≤ d[u] + w(u, v) just before the relaxation, then neither d[u]
nor d[v] changes, and so d[v] ≤ d[u] + w(u, v) afterward.
