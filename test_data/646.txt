We can obtain u in a similar manner from P5 by using P1 and P3 to move the inessential terms
of P5 in a different direction:

By subtracting an additional product

we now obtain

The 7 submatrix products P1, P2, . . . , P7 can thus be used to compute the product C = AB,
which completes the description of Strassen's method.
Discussion
From a practical point of view, Strassen's algorithm is often not the method of choice for
matrix multiplication, for four reasons:
1. The constant factor hidden in the running time of Strassen's algorithm is larger than
the constant factor in the naive Î˜(n3) method.
2. When the matrices are sparse, methods tailored for sparse matrices are faster.
3. Strassen's algorithm is not quite as numerically stable as the naive method.
4. The submatrices formed at the levels of recursion consume space.
