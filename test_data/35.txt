fully expanded tree in part (d) has lg n + 1 levels (i.e., it has height lg n, as indicated), and
each level contributes a total cost of cn. The total cost, therefore, is cn lg n + cn, which is Θ(n
lg n).
Next, we add the costs across each level of the tree. The top level has total cost cn, the next
level down has total cost c(n/2) + c(n/2) = cn, the level after that has total cost c(n/4) + c(n/4)
+ c(n/4) + c(n/4) = cn, and so on. In general, the level i below the top has 2i nodes, each
contributing a cost of c(n/2i), so that the ith level below the top has total cost 2i c(n/2i) = cn.
At the bottom level, there are n nodes, each contributing a cost of c, for a total cost of cn.
The total number of levels of the "recursion tree" in Figure 2.5 is lg n + 1. This fact is easily
seen by an informal inductive argument. The base case occurs when n = 1, in which case there
is only one level. Since lg 1 = 0, we have that lg n + 1 gives the correct number of levels.
Now assume as an inductive hypothesis that the number of levels of a recursion tree for 2i
nodes is lg 2i + 1 = i + 1 (since for any value of i, we have that lg 2i = i). Because we are
assuming that the original input size is a power of 2, the next input size to consider is 2i+1. A
tree with 2i+1 nodes has one more level than a tree of 2i nodes, and so the total number of
levels is (i + 1) + 1 = lg 2i+1 + 1.
To compute the total cost represented by the recurrence (2.2), we simply add up the costs of
all the levels. There are lg n + 1 levels, each costing cn, for a total cost of cn(lg n + 1) = cn lg
n + cn. Ignoring the low-order term and the constant c gives the desired result of Θ(n lg n).
