We modify the recursion tree of Figure 4.3 to produce the recursion tree in Figure 4.4. As we
go down in the recursion tree, we obtain a sequence of recursive invocations on the arguments

Figure 4.4: The recursion tree generated by T(n) = aT(⌈n/b⌉) + f(n). The recursive argument
nj is given by equation (4.12).

n ,

⌈n/b⌉ ,

⌈⌈n/b⌉/b⌉ ,

⌈⌈⌈n/b⌉/b⌉/b⌉ ,
⋮

Let us denote the jth element in the sequence by nj, where
(4.12)

Our first goal is to determine the depth k such that nk is a constant. Using the inequality ⌈x⌉ ≤
x + 1, we obtain

In general,
