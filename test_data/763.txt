As an example of the application of the Chinese remainder theorem, suppose we are given the
two equations
a ≡ 2 (mod 5),
a ≡ 3 (mod 13),
so that a1 = 2, n1 = m2 = 5, a2 = 3, and n2 = m1 = 13, and we wish to compute a mod 65, since
n = 65. Because 13-1 ≡ 2 (mod 5) and 5-1 ≡ 8 (mod 13), we have
c1 = 13(2 mod 5) = 26,
c2 = 5(8 mod 13) = 40,
and
a ≡ 2 · 26 + 3 · 40 (mod 65)
≡ 52 + 120
(mod 65)
≡ 42
(mod 65).
See Figure 31.3 for an illustration of the Chinese remainder theorem, modulo 65.

Figure 31.3: An illustration of the Chinese remainder theorem for n1 = 5 and n2 = 13. For this
example, c1 = 26 and c2 = 40. In row i, column j is shown the value of a, modulo 65, such that
(a mod 5) = i and (a mod 13) = j. Note that row 0, column 0 contains a 0. Similarly, row
4,column 12 contains a 64 (equivalent to -1). Since c1 = 26, moving down a row increases a
by 26. Similarly, c2 = 40 means that moving right by a column increases a by 40. Increasing a
by 1 corresponds to moving diagonally downward and to the right, wrapping around from the
bottom to the top and from the right to the left.
Thus, we can work modulo n by working modulo n directly or by working in the transformed
representation using separate modulo ni computations, as convenient. The computations are
entirely equivalent.
