Fibonacci numbers are related to the golden ratio φ and to its conjugate , which are given by
the following formulas:
(3.22)

Specifically, we have
(3.23)

which can be proved by induction (Exercise 3.2-6). Since
, we have
so that the ith Fibonacci number Fi is equal to
rounded to the nearest integer. Thus,
Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially.
Exercises 3.2-1
Show that if f(n) and g(n) are monotonically increasing functions, then so are the functions
f(n) + g(n) and f (g(n)), and if f(n) and g(n) are in addition nonnegative, then f(n) · g(n) is
monotonically increasing.

Exercises 3.2-2
Prove equation (3.15).

Exercises 3.2-3
Prove equation (3.18). Also prove that n! = ω(2n) and n! = o(nn).

Exercises 3.2-4:
