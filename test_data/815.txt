of which can be computationally expensive and prone to problems with round-off error. For
example, the "straightforward" method of determining whether two segments intersectcompute the line equation of the form y = mx + b for each segment (m is the slope and b is the
y-intercept), find the point of intersection of the lines, and check whether this point is on both
segments-uses division to find the point of intersection. When the segments are nearly
parallel, this method is very sensitive to the precision of the division operation on real
computers. The method in this section, which avoids division, is much more accurate.
Cross products
Computing cross products is at the heart of our line-segment methods. Consider vectors p1
and p2, shown in Figure 33.1(a). The cross product p1 × p2 can be interpreted as the signed
area of the parallelogram formed by the points (0, 0), p1, p2, and p1 + p2 = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2). An
equivalent, but more useful, definition gives the cross product as the determinant of a
matrix:[1]

Figure 33.1: (a) The cross product of vectors p1 and p2 is the signed area of the parallelogram.
(b) The lightly shaded region contains vectors that are clockwise from p. The darkly shaded
region contains vectors that are counterclockwise from p.
If p1 × p2 is positive, then p1 is clockwise from p2 with respect to the origin (0, 0); if this cross
product is negative, then p1 is counterclockwise from p2. (See Exercise 33.1-1.) Figure 33.1(b)
shows the clockwise and counterclockwise regions relative to a vector p. A boundary
condition arises if the cross product is 0; in this case, the vectors are collinear, pointing in
either the same or opposite directions.
To determine whether a directed segment
is clockwise from a directed segment
with
respect to their common endpoint p0, we simply translate to use p0 as the origin. That is, we

, and we define p2 - p0
let p1 - p0 denote the vector
similarly. We then compute the cross product
(p1 - p0) × (p2 - p0) = (x1 - x0)(y2 - y0) - (x2 - x0)(y1 - y0).
If this cross product is positive, then
