feasible either. In line 7, therefore, we perform one call of PIVOT, with x0 entering and xl
leaving, where the index l is chosen in line 1 to be the index of the most negative bi. We shall
see shortly that the basic solution resulting from this call of PIVOT will be feasible. Now that
we have a slack form for which the basic solution is feasible, we can, in line 9, repeatedly call
PIVOT to fully solve the auxiliary linear program. As the test in line 10 demonstrates, if we
find an optimal solution to Laux with objective value 0, then in line 11, we create a slack form
for L for which the basic solution is feasible. To do so, we delete all x0 terms from the
constraints and restore the original objective function for L. The original objective function
may contain both basic and nonbasic variables. Therefore, in the objective function we
replace each basic variable by the right-hand side of its associated constraint. On the other
hand, if in line 10 we discover that the original linear program L is infeasible, we return this
information in line 12.
We now demonstrate the operation of INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX on the linear program
(29.105)â€“(29.108). This linear program is feasible if we can find nonnegative values for x1
and x2 that satisfy inequalities (29.106) and (29.107). Using Lemma 29.11, we formulate the
auxiliary linear program
(29.112)
subject to
(29.113)
(29.114)

By Lemma 29.11, if the optimal objective value of this auxiliary linear program is 0, then the
original linear program has a feasible solution. If the optimal objective value of this auxiliary
linear program is positive, then the original linear program does not have a feasible solution.
We write this linear program in slack form, obtaining
- x0
z=
x3 = 2 - 2x1 + x2 + x0
x4 = -4 - x1 + 5x2 + x0.
We are not out of the woods yet, because the basic solution, which would set x4 = -4, is not
feasible for this auxiliary linear program. We can, however, with one call to PIVOT, convert
this slack form into one in which the basic solution is feasible. As line 7 indicates, we choose
x0 to be the entering variable. In line 1, we choose as the leaving variable x4, which is the
basic variable whose value in the basic solution is most negative. After pivoting, we have the
slack form
z = -4 - x1 + 5x2 - x4
x0 = 4 + x1 - 5x2 + x4
x3 = 6 - x1 - 4x2 + x4.
