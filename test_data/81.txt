Professor Diogenes has n supposedly identical VLSI[1] chips that in principle are capable of
testing each other. The professor's test jig accommodates two chips at a time. When the jig is
loaded, each chip tests the other and reports whether it is good or bad. A good chip always
reports accurately whether the other chip is good or bad, but the answer of a bad chip cannot
be trusted. Thus, the four possible outcomes of a test are as follows:
Chip A says Chip B says Conclusion
B is good
B is good
B is bad
B is bad

A is good
A is bad
A is good
A is bad

both are good, or both are bad
at least one is bad
at least one is bad
at least one is bad

a. Show that if more than n/2 chips are bad, the professor cannot necessarily determine
which chips are good using any strategy based on this kind of pairwise test. Assume
that the bad chips can conspire to fool the professor.
b. Consider the problem of finding a single good chip from among n chips, assuming that
more than n/2 of the chips are good. Show that ⌊n/2⌋ pairwise tests are sufficient to
reduce the problem to one of nearly half the size.
c. Show that the good chips can be identified with Θ(n) pairwise tests, assuming that
more than n/2 of the chips are good. Give and solve the recurrence that describes the
number of tests.

Problems 4-7: Monge arrays
An m × n array A of real numbers is a Monge array if for all i, j, k, and l such that 1 ≤ i < k ≤
m and 1 ≤ j < l ≤ n, we have
A[i, j] + A[k, l] ≤ A[i, l] + A[k, j].
In other words, whenever we pick two rows and two columns of a Monge array and consider
the four elements at the intersections of the rows and the columns, the sum of the upper-left
and lower-right elements is less or equal to the sum of the lower-left and upper-right
elements. For example, the following array is Monge:
10 17 13 28 23
17 22 16 29 23
24 28 22 34 24
11 13 6 17 7
45 44 32 37 23
36 33 19 21 6
75 66 51 53 34
