of just 1 or 2 numbers is bitonic. The zero-one sequences that are bitonic have a simple
structure. They have the form 0i 1j 0k or the form 1i 0j 1k, for some i, j, k â‰¥ 0. Note that a
sequence that is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing is also bitonic.
The bitonic sorter that we shall construct is a comparison network that sorts bitonic sequences
of 0's and 1's. Exercise 27.3-6 asks you to show that the bitonic sorter can sort bitonic
sequences of arbitrary numbers.
The half-cleaner
A bitonic sorter is composed of several stages, each of which is called a half-cleaner. Each
half-cleaner is a comparison network of depth 1 in which input line i is compared with line i +
n/2 for i = 1, 2,..., n/2. (We assume that n is even.) Figure 27.7 shows HALF-CLEANER[8],
the half-cleaner with 8 inputs and 8 outputs.

Figure 27.7: The comparison network HALF-CLEANER[8]. Two different sample zero-one
input and output values are shown. The input is assumed to be bitonic. A half-cleaner ensures
that every output element of the top half is at least as small as every output element of the
bottom half. Moreover, both halves are bitonic, and at least one half is clean.
When a bitonic sequence of 0's and 1's is applied as input to a half-cleaner, the half-cleaner
produces an output sequence in which smaller values are in the top half, larger values are in
the bottom half, and both halves are bitonic. In fact, at least one of the halves is cleanconsisting of either all 0's or all 1's-and it is from this property that we derive the name "halfcleaner." (Note that all clean sequences are bitonic.) The next lemma proves these properties
of half-cleaners.
Lemma 27.3
If the input to a half-cleaner is a bitonic sequence of 0's and 1's, then the output satisfies the
following properties: both the top half and the bottom half are bitonic, every element in the
top half is at least as small as every element of the bottom half, and at least one half is clean.
Proof The comparison network HALF-CLEANER[n] compares inputs i and i + n/2 for i = 1,
2,..., n/2. Without loss of generality, suppose that the input is of the form 00 ... 011 ... 100 ...
0. (The situation in which the input is of the form 11 ... 100 ... 011 ... 1 is symmetric.) There
are three possible cases depending upon the block of consecutive 0's or 1's in which the
midpoint n/2 falls, and one of these cases (the one in which the midpoint occurs in the block
of 1's) is further split into two cases. The four cases are shown in Figure 27.8. In each case
shown, the lemma holds.
