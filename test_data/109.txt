considering A[1], A[2], A[3],..., A[n] until either A[i] = x is found or the end of the array is
reached. Assume that all possible permutations of the input array are equally likely.
e. Suppose that there is exactly one index i such that A[i] = x. What is the expected
running time of DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH? What is the worst-case running time of
DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH?
f. Generalizing your solution to part (e), suppose that there are k ≥ 1 indices i such that
A[i] = x. What is the expected running time of DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH? What is
the worst-case running time of DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH? Your answer should be
a function of n and k.
g. Suppose that there are no indices i such that A[i] = x. What is the expected running
time of DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH? What is the worst-case running time of
DETERMINISTIC-SEARCH?
Finally, consider a randomized algorithm SCRAMBLE-SEARCH that works by first
randomly permuting the input array and then running the deterministic linear search given
above on the resulting permuted array.
h. Letting k be the number of indices i such that A[i] = x, give the worst-case and
expected running times of SCRAMBLE-SEARCH for the cases in which k = 0 and k =
1. Generalize your solution to handle the case in which k ≥ 1.
i. Which of the three searching algorithms would you use? Explain your answer.

Chapter notes
Bollobás [44], Hofri [151], and Spencer [283] contain a wealth of advanced probabilistic
techniques. The advantages of randomized algorithms are discussed and surveyed by Karp
[174] and Rabin [253]. The textbook by Motwani and Raghavan [228] gives an extensive
treatment of randomized algorithms.
Several variants of the hiring problem have been widely studied. These problems are more
commonly referred to as "secretary problems." An example of work in this area is the paper
by Ajtai, Meggido, and Waarts [12].
