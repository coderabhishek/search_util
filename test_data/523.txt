Suppose that we order the edge relaxations in each pass of the Bellman-Ford algorithm as
follows. Before the first pass, we assign an arbitrary linear order v1, v2,..., v|v| to the vertices of
the input graph G = (V, E). Then, we partition the edge set E into Ef Eb, where Ef = {(vi , vj)
E : i < j} and Eb = {(vi, vj) E : i > j}. (Assume that G contains no self-loops, so that every
edge is in either Ef or Eb.) Define Gf = (V, Ef) and Gb = (V, Eb).
a. Prove that Gf is acyclic with topological sort
with topological sort v|V|, v|V|-1,...,v1 .

v1, v2,..., v|V|

and that Gb is acyclic

Suppose that we implement each pass of the Bellman-Ford algorithm in the following way.
We visit each vertex in the order v1, v2,..., v|V|, relaxing edges of Ef that leave the vertex. We
then visit each vertex in the order v|V|, v|V|-1,..., v1, relaxing edges of Eb that leave the vertex.
b. Prove that with this scheme, if G contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable
from the source vertex s, then after only ⌈|V | /2⌉ passes over the edges, d[v] = δ(s, v)
for all vertices v V.
c. Does this scheme improve the asymptotic running time of the Bellman-Ford
algorithm?

Problems 24-2: Nesting boxes
A d-dimensional box with dimensions (x1, x2,..., xd) nests within another box with dimensions
(y1, y2,..., yd) if there exists a permutation π on {1, 2,..., d} such that xπ(1) < y1, xπ(2) < y2,..., xπ(d)
< yd .
a. Argue that the nesting relation is transitive.
b. Describe an efficient method to determine whether or not one d-dimensional box nests
inside another.
c. Suppose that you are given a set of n d-dimensional boxes {B1, B2,..., Bn}. Describe an
of boxes such that
efficient algorithm to determine the longest sequence
nests within
for j = 1, 2,..., k - 1. Express the running time of your algorithm in
terms of n and d.

Problems 24-3: Arbitrage
Arbitrage is the use of discrepancies in currency exchange rates to transform one unit of a
currency into more than one unit of the same currency. For example, suppose that 1 U.S.
dollar buys 46.4 Indian rupees, 1 Indian rupee buys 2.5 Japanese yen, and 1 Japanese yen
buys 0.0091 U.S. dollars. Then, by converting currencies, a trader can start with 1 U.S. dollar
and buy 46.4 × 2.5 × 0.0091 = 1.0556 U.S. dollars, thus turning a profit of 5.56 percent.
Suppose that we are given n currencies c1, c2,..., cn and an n × n table R of exchange rates,
such that one unit of currency ci buys R[i, j] units of currency cj.
