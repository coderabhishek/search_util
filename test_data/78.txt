since
is a constant. Thus, case 2 is proved. The proof of case 1 is almost
identical. The key is to prove the bound
, which is similar to the corresponding
proof of case 2, though the algebra is more intricate.
We have now proved the upper bounds in the master theorem for all integers n. The proof of
the lower bounds is similar.
Exercises 4.4-1:
Give a simple and exact expression for nj in equation (4.12) for the case in which b is a
positive integer instead of an arbitrary real number.

Exercises 4.4-2:
Show that if

, where k ≥ 0, then the master recurrence has solution
. For simplicity, confine your analysis to exact powers of b.

Exercises 4.4-3:
Show that case 3 of the master theorem is overstated, in the sense that the regularity condition
af(n/b) ≤ cf(n) for some constant c < 1 implies that there exists a constant > 0 such that
.

T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n3.
T(n) = T(9n/10) + n.
T(n) = 16T(n/4) + n2.
T (n) = 7T(n/3) + n2.
T(n) = 7T(n/2) + n2.
