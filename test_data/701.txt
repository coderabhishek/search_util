pick an arbitrary index i I, and set xi = 1 and xk = 0 for all k ≠ i. Then we must have αi = βi.
Since we picked i as any index in i, we conclude that αi = βi for each i I.

We now show that the slack form of a linear program is uniquely determined by the set of
basic variables.
Lemma 29.4
Let (A, b, c) be a linear program in standard form. Given a set B of basic variables, the
associated slack form is uniquely determined.
Proof Assume for purpose of contradiction that there are two different slack forms with the
same set B of basic variables. The slack forms must also have identical sets N = {1, 2, ..., n +
m} - B of nonbasic variables. We write the first slack form as
(29.82)
(29.83)
and the second as
(29.84)
(29.85)
Consider the system of equations formed by subtracting each equation in line (29.85) from the
corresponding equation in line (29.83). The resulting system is

or, equivalently,

Now, for each i B, apply Lemma 29.3 with αi = aij,
, and
. Since αi = βi, we
have that
for each j N, and since γ = 0, we have that
. Thus, for the two slack
forms, A and b are identical to A′ and b′. Using a similar argument, Exercise 29.3-1 shows that
it must also be the case that c = c′ and v = v′, and hence that the slack forms must be identical.
