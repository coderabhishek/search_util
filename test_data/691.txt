Put the single-pair shortest-path linear program from (29.44)–(29.46) into standard form.

Exercises 29.2-2
Write out explicitly the linear program corresponding to finding the shortest path from node s
to node y in Figure 24.2(a).

Exercises 29.2-3
In the single-source shortest-paths problem, we want to find the shortest-path weights from a
source vertex s to all vertices v V. Given a graph G, write a linear program for which the
solution has the property that d[v] is the shortest-path weight from s to v for each vertex v
V.

Exercises 29.2-4
Write out explicitly the linear program corresponding to finding the maximum flow in Figure
26.1(a).

Exercises 29.2-5
Rewrite the linear program for maximum flow (29.47)–(29.50) so that it uses only O(V + E)
constraints.

Exercises 29.2-6
Write a linear program that, given a bipartite graph G = (V, E), solves the maximum-bipartitematching problem.
