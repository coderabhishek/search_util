Figure 26.9: Discharging a vertex y. It takes 15 iterations of the while loop of DISCHARGE
to push all the excess flow from y. Only the neighbors of y and edges entering or leaving y are
shown. In each part, the number inside each vertex is its excess at the beginning of the first
iteration shown in the part, and each vertex is shown at its height throughout the part. To the
