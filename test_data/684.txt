Applying this conversion to each constraint of a linear program in standard form, we obtain a
linear program in a different form. For example, for the linear program described in (29.24)–
(29.28), we introduce slack variables x4, x5, and x6, obtaining maximize
(29.33)
subject to
(29.34)
(29.35)
(29.36)
(29.37)
In this linear program, all the constraints except for the nonnegativity constraints are
equalities, and each variable is subject to a nonnegativity constraint. We write each equality
constraint with one of the variables on the left-hand side of the equality and all others on the
right-hand side. Furthermore, each equation has the same set of variables on the right-hand
side, and these variables are also the only ones that appear in the objective function. The
variables on the left-hand side of the equalities are called basic variables, and those on the
right-hand side are called nonbasic variables.
For linear programs that satisfy these conditions, we shall sometimes omit the words
"maximize" and "subject to," and we shall omit the explicit nonnegativity constraints. We
shall also use the variable z to denote the value of the objective function. We call the resulting
format slack form. If we write the linear program given in (29.33)–(29.37) in slack form, we
obtain
(29.38)
(29.39)
(29.40)
(29.41)
As with standard form, it will be convenient to have a more concise notation for describing a
slack form. As we shall see in Section 29.3, the sets of basic and nonbasic variables will
change as the simplex algorithm runs. We use N to denote the set of indices of the nonbasic
variables and B to denote the set of indices of the basic variables. We will always have that |N|
= n, |B| = m, and N B = {1, 2, ..., n + m}. The equations will be indexed by the entries of B,
and the variables on the right-hand sides will be indexed by the entries of N. As in standard
form, we use bi , cj , and aij to denote constant terms and coefficients. We also use v to denote
an optional constant term in the objective function. Thus we can concisely define a slack form
by a tuple (N, B, A, b, c, v), denoting the slack form
(29.42)
(29.43)
in which all variables x are constrained to be nonnegative. Because we subtract the sum
in (29.43), the values aij are actually the negatives of the coefficients as they "appear"
in the slack form.
