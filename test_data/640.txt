Exercises 28.1-2
Prove that (AB)T = BT AT and that AT A is always a symmetric matrix.

Exercises 28.1-3
Prove that matrix inverses are unique, that is, if B and C are inverses of A, then B = C.

Exercises 28.1-4
Prove that the product of two lower-triangular matrices is lower-triangular. Prove that the
determinant of a lower-triangular or upper-triangular matrix is equal to the product of its
diagonal elements. Prove that the inverse of a lower-triangular matrix, if it exists, is lowertriangular.

Exercises 28.1-5
Prove that if P is an n × n permutation matrix and A is an n × n matrix, then P A can be
obtained from A by permuting its rows, and AP can be obtained from A by permuting its
columns. Prove that the product of two permutation matrices is a permutation matrix. Prove
that if P is a permutation matrix, then P is invertible, its inverse is PT, and PT is a permutation
matrix.

Exercises 28.1-6
Let A and B be n × n matrices such that AB = I. Prove that if A′ is obtained from A by adding
row j into row i, then the inverse B′ of A′ can be obtained by subtracting column i from
column j of B.
