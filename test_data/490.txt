Problems 23-4: Alternative minimum-spanning-tree algorithms
In this problem, we give pseudocode for three different algorithms. Each one takes a graph as
input and returns a set of edges T. For each algorithm, you must either prove that T is a
minimum spanning tree or prove that T is not a minimum spanning tree. Also describe the
most efficient implementation of each algorithm, whether or not it computes a minimum
spanning tree.

Chapter notes
Tarjan [292] surveys the minimum-spanning-tree problem and provides excellent advanced
material. A history of the minimum-spanning-tree problem has been written by Graham and
Hell [131].
Tarjan attributes the first minimum-spanning-tree algorithm to a 1926 paper by O. Boruvka.
Boruvka's algorithm consists of running O(lg V) iterations of the procedure MST-REDUCE
described in Problem 23-2. Kruskal's algorithm was reported by Kruskal [195] in 1956. The
algorithm commonly known as Prim's algorithm was indeed invented by Prim [250], but it
was also invented earlier by V. Jarník in 1930.
The reason why greedy algorithms are effective at finding minimum spanning trees is that the
set of forests of a graph forms a graphic matroid. (See Section 16.4.)
When |E| = Ω(V lg V), Prim's algorithm, implemented with Fibonacci heaps runs in O(E) time.
For sparser graphs, using a combination of the ideas from Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's
algorithm, and Boruvka's algorithm, together with advanced data structures, Fredman and
