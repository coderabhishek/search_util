= (xTx)1/2.
Thus, the norm of x is its length in n-dimensional euclidean space.
Matrix inverses, ranks, and determinants
We define the inverse of an n × n matrix A to be the n × n matrix, denoted A-1 (if it exists),
such that AA-1 = In = A-1 A. For example,

Many nonzero n × n matrices do not have inverses. A matrix without an inverse is called
noninvertible, or singular. An example of a nonzero singular matrix is

If a matrix has an inverse, it is called invertible, or nonsingular. Matrix inverses, when they
exist, are unique. (See Exercise 28.1-3.) If A and B are nonsingular n × n matrices, then
(28.6)
The inverse operation commutes with the transpose operation:
(A-1)T = (AT)-1.
The vectors x1, x2, . . . , xn are linearly dependent if there exist coefficients c1, c2, . . . , cn, not
all of which are zero, such that c1x1 + c2x2 + · · · + cn xn = 0. For example, the row vectors x1 =
(1 2 3 ), x2 = (2 6 4), and x3 = (4 11 9) are linearly dependent, since 2x1 + 3x2 - 2x3 = 0. If
vectors are not linearly dependent, they are linearly independent. For example, the columns
of an identity matrix are linearly independent.
The column rank of a nonzero m × n matrix A is the size of the largest set of linearly
independent columns of A. Similarly, the row rank of A is the size of the largest set of linearly
independent rows of A. A fundamental property of any matrix A is that its row rank always
equals its column rank, so that we can simply refer to the rank of A. The rank of an m × n
matrix is an integer between 0 and min(m, n), inclusive. (The rank of a zero matrix is 0, and
the rank of an n × n identity matrix is n.) An alternate, but equivalent and often more useful,
definition is that the rank of a nonzero m × n matrix A is the smallest number r such that there
exist matrices B and C of respective sizes m × r and r × n such that
A = BC.
A square n × n matrix has full rank if its rank is n. An m × n matrix has full column rank if
its rank is n. A fundamental property of ranks is given by the following theorem.
