The target t has a 1 in each digit labeled by a variable and a 4 in each digit labeled by a
clause.
For each variable xi, there are two integers, vi and , in S. Each has a 1 in the digit
labeled by xi and 0's in the other variable digits. If literal xi appears in clause Cj, then
the digit labeled by Cj in vi contains a 1. If literal ¬xi appears in clause Cj, then the
digit labeled by Cj in contains a 1. All other digits labeled by clauses in vi and are 0.
All vi and values in set S are unique. Why? For l ≠ i, no vl or values can equal vi and
in the most significant n digits. Furthermore, by our simplifying assumptions above,
no vi and can be equal in all k least significant digits. If vi and were equal, then xi
and ¬xi would have to appear in exactly the same set of clauses. But we assume that no
clause contains both xi and ¬xi and that either xi or ¬xi appears in some clause, and so
there must be some clause Cj for which vi and differ.

For each clause Cj, there are two integers, sj and in S. Each has 0's in all digits other
than the one labeled by Cj. For sj, there is a 1 in the Cj digit, and has a 2 in this digit.
These integers are "slack variables," which we use to get each clause-labeled digit
position to add to the target value of 4.
Simple inspection of Figure 34.19 demonstrates that all sj and
in set S.

values in S are unique

Figure 34.19: The reduction of 3-CNF-SAT to SUBSET-SUM. The formula in 3-CNF
is φ = C1 C2 C3 C4, where C1 = (x1 ¬x2 ¬x3), C2 = (¬x1 ¬x2 ¬x3), C3 =
(¬x1 ¬x2 x3), and C4 = (x1 x2 x3). A satisfying assignment of φ is x1 = 0, x2 = 0, x3
= 1 . The set S produced by the reduction consists of the base-10 numbers shown;
reading from top to bottom, S = {1001001, 1000110, 100001, 101110, 10011, 11100,
1000, 2000, 100, 200, 10, 20, 1, 2}. The target t is 1114444. The subset S' S is
lightly shaded, and it contains
, and , corresponding to the satisfying
assignment. It also contains slack variables
, and to achieve the target
value of 4 in the digits labeled by C1 through C4.
Note that the greatest sum of digits in any one digit position is 6, which occurs in the digits
labeled by clauses (three 1's from the vi and values, plus 1 and 2 from the sj and values).
