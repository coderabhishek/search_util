point joining two consecutive sides is called a vertex of the polygon. If the polygon is simple,
as we shall generally assume, it does not cross itself. The set of points in the plane enclosed
by a simple polygon forms the interior of the polygon, the set of points on the polygon itself
forms its boundary, and the set of points surrounding the polygon forms its exterior. A simple
polygon is convex if, given any two points on its boundary or in its interior, all points on the
line segment drawn between them are contained in the polygon's boundary or interior.
Professor Amundsen proposes the following method to determine whether a sequence p0,
p1, ..., pn-1 of n points forms the consecutive vertices of a convex polygon. Output "yes" if
the set { pi pi+1 pi+2 : i = 0, 1, ..., n - 1}, where subscript addition is performed modulo n,
does not contain both left turns and right turns; otherwise, output "no." Show that although
this method runs in linear time, it does not always produce the correct answer. Modify the
professor's method so that it always produces the correct answer in linear time.

Exercises 33.1-6
Given a point p0 = (x0, y0), the right horizontal ray from p0 is the set of points {pi = (xi, yi) : xi
≥ x0 and yi = y0}, that is, it is the set of points due right of p0 along with p0 itself. Show how to
determine whether a given right horizontal ray from p0 intersects a line segment
in O(1)
time by reducing the problem to that of determining whether two line segments intersect.

Exercises 33.1-7
One way to determine whether a point p0 is in the interior of a simple, but not necessarily
convex, polygon P is to look at any ray from p0 and check that the ray intersects the boundary
of P an odd number of times but that p0 itself is not on the boundary of P. Show how to
compute in Θ(n) time whether a point p0 is in the interior of an n-vertex polygon P. (Hint: Use
Exercise 33.1-6. Make sure your algorithm is correct when the ray intersects the polygon
boundary at a vertex and when the ray overlaps a side of the polygon.)

Exercises 33.1-8
Show how to compute the area of an n-vertex simple, but not necessarily convex, polygon in
Θ(n) time. (See Exercise 33.1-5 for definitions pertaining to polygons.)

Actually, the cross product is a three-dimensional concept. It is a vector that is
perpendicular to both p1 and p2 according to the "right-hand rule" and whose magnitude is |x1
