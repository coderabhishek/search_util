Find a feasible solution or determine that no feasible solution exists for the following system
of difference constraints:
x1 - x2 ≤ 4,
x1 - x5 ≤ 5,
x2 - x4 ≤ -6,
x3 - x2 ≤ 1,
x4 - x1 ≤ 3,
x4 - x3 ≤ 5,
x4 - x5 ≤ 10
,
x5 - x3 ≤ -4,
x5 - x4 ≤ -8.
Exercises 24.4-3
Can any shortest-path weight from the new vertex v0 in a constraint graph be positive?
Explain.

Exercises 24.4-4
Express the single-pair shortest-path problem as a linear program.

Exercises 24.4-5
Show how to modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm slightly so that when it is used to solve a
system of difference constraints with m inequalities on n unknowns, the running time is
O(nm).

Exercises 24.4-6
Suppose that in addition to a system of difference constraints, we want to handle equality
constraints of the form xi = xj + bk. Show how the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be adapted to
solve this variety of constraint system.
