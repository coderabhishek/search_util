To see that is well defined, note that for 0 ≤ a < n, we have a ≡ (a + kn) (mod n) for all
integers k. By Exercise 31.2-3, therefore, gcd(a, n) = 1 implies gcd(a + kn, n) = 1 for all
integers k. Since [a]n = {a + kn : k Z}, the set is well defined. An example of such a
group is

where the group operation is multiplication modulo 15. (Here we denote an element [a]15 as a;
for example, we denote [7]15 as 7.) Figure 31.2(b) shows the group (
). For example, 8·11
≡ 13 mod 15), working in . The identity for this group is 1.
Theorem 31.13
The system (

) is a finite abelian group.

Proof Theorem 31.6 implies that (
) is closed. Associativity and commutativity can be
proved for ·n as they were for +n in the proof of Theorem 31.12. The identity element is [1]n.
To show the existence of inverses, let a be an element of and let (d, x, y) be the output of
EXTENDED-EUCLID(a, n). Then d = 1, since
, and
ax + ny = 1
or, equivalently,
ax ≡ 1 (mod n).
Thus, [x]n is a multiplicative inverse of [a]n, modulo n. The proof that inverses are uniquely
defined is deferred until Corollary 31.26.

As an example of computing multiplicative inverses, suppose that a = 5 and n = 11. Then
EXTENDED-EUCLID(a, n) returns (d, x, y) = (1, -2, 1), so that 1 = 5 · (-2) + 11 · 1. Thus, -2
(i.e., 9 mod 11) is a multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 11.
When working with the groups (Zn, +n) and (
) in the remainder of this chapter, we follow
the convenient practice of denoting equivalence classes by their representative elements and
denoting the operations +n and ·n by the usual arithmetic notations + and · (or juxtaposition)
respectively. Also, equivalences modulo n may also be interpreted as equations in Zn. For
example, the following two statements are equivalent:
ax ≡ b (mod n) ,
[a]n ·n [x]n = [b]n .
As a further convenience, we sometimes refer to a group (S, ) merely as S when the
operation is understood from context. We may thus refer to the groups (Zn, +n) and (
Zn and , respectively.
