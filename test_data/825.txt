Give an O(n lg n)-time algorithm to determine whether an n-vertex polygon is simple.

Exercises 33.2-5
Give an O(n lg n)-time algorithm to determine whether two simple polygons with a total of n
vertices intersect.

Exercises 33.2-6
A disk consists of a circle plus its interior and is represented by its center point and radius.
Two disks intersect if they have any point in common. Give an O(n lg n)-time algorithm to
determine whether any two disks in a set of n intersect.

Exercises 33.2-7
Given a set of n line segments containing a total of k intersections, show how to output all k
intersections in O((n + k) lg n) time.

Exercises 33.2-8
Argue that ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT works correctly even if three or more segments
intersect at the same point.

Exercises 33.2-9
Show that ANY-SEGMENTS-INTERSECT works correctly in the presence of vertical
segments if the bottom endpoint of a vertical segment is processed as if it were a left endpoint
and the top endpoint is processed as if it were a right endpoint. How does your answer to
Exercise 33.2-2 change if vertical segments are allowed?
