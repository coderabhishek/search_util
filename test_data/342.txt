maximum-weight independent subset for M′, and the overall operation of GREEDY will find
a maximum-weight independent subset for M.

Exercises 16.4-1
Show that (S,ℓk) is a matroid, where S is any finite set andℓk is the set of all subsets of S of
size at most k, where k ≤ |S|.

Exercises 16.4-2:
Given an m × n matrix T over some field (such as the reals), show that (S,ℓ) is a matroid,
where S is the set of columns of T and A ℓ if and only if the columns in A are linearly
independent.

Exercises 16.4-3:
Show that if (S,ℓ) is a matroid, then (S,ℓ′) is a matroid, where
ℓ′ = {A′ : S - A′ contains some maximal A

ℓ}.

That is, the maximal independent sets of (S,ℓ′) are just the complements of the maximal
independent sets of (S,ℓ).

Exercises 16.4-4:
Let S be a finite set and let S1, S2, ..., Sk be a partition of S into nonempty disjoint subsets.
Define the structure (S,ℓ) by the condition thatℓ = {A : |A ∩ Si| ≤ 1 for i = 1, 2, ..., k}. Show
that (S,ℓ) is a matroid. That is, the set of all sets A that contain at most one member in each
block of the partition determines the independent sets of a matroid.

Exercises 16.4-5
Show how to transform the weight function of a weighted matroid problem, where the desired
optimal solution is a minimum-weight maximal independent subset, to make it an standard
weighted-matroid problem. Argue carefully that your transformation is correct.
