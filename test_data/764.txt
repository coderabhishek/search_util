Exercises 31.5-2
Find all integers x that leave remainders 1, 2, 3 when divided by 9, 8, 7 respectively.

Exercises 31.5-3
Argue that, under the definitions of Theorem 31.27, if gcd(a, n) = 1, then
.

Exercises 31.5-4
Under the definitions of Theorem 31.27, prove that for any polynomial f, the number of roots
of the equation f(x) ≡ 0 (mod n) is equal to the product of the number of roots of each of the
equations f(x) ≡ 0 (mod n1), f(x) ≡ 0 (mod n2), ..., f(x) ≡ 0 (mod nk).

31.6 Powers of an element
Just as it is natural to consider the multiples of a given element a, modulo n, it is often natural
to consider the sequence of powers of a, modulo n, where
:
(31.29)
modulo n. Indexing from 0, the 0th value in this sequence is a0 mod n = 1, and the ith value is
ai mod n. For example, the powers of 3 modulo 7 are
i
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
3 mod 7 1 3 2 6 4 5 1 3 2 6 4 5
i

whereas the powers of 2 modulo 7 are
i
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
2 mod 7 1 2 4 1 2 4 1 2 4 1 2 4
i
