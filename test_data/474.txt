a. Prove that in a breadth-first search of an undirected graph, the following properties
hold:
1. There are no back edges and no forward edges.
2. For each tree edge (u, v), we have d[v] = d[u] + 1.
3. For each cross edge (u, v), we have d[v] = d[u] or d[v] = d[u] + 1.
b. Prove that in a breadth-first search of a directed graph, the following properties hold:
1. There are no forward edges.
2. For each tree edge (u, v), we have d[v] = d[u] + 1.
3. For each cross edge (u, v), we have d[v] ≤ d[u] + 1.
4. For each back edge (u, v), we have 0 ≤ d[v] ≤ d[u].

Problems 22-2: Articulation points, bridges, and biconnected components
Let G = (V, E) be a connected, undirected graph. An articulation point of G is a vertex whose
removal disconnects G. A bridge of G is an edge whose removal disconnects G. A
biconnected component of G is a maximal set of edges such that any two edges in the set lie
on a common simple cycle. Figure 22.10 illustrates these definitions. We can determine
articulation points, bridges, and biconnected components using depth-first search. Let Gπ =
(V, Eπ) be a depth-first tree of G.

Figure 22.10: The articulation points, bridges, and biconnected components of a connected,
undirected graph for use in Problem 22-2. The articulation points are the heavily shaded
vertices, the bridges are the heavily shaded edges, and the biconnected components are the
edges in the shaded regions, with a bcc numbering shown.
a. Prove that the root of Gπ is an articulation point of G if and only if it has at least two
children in Gπ.
b. Let v be a nonroot vertex of Gπ. Prove that v is an articulation point of G if and only if
v has a child s such that there is no back edge from s or any descendant of s to a proper
ancestor of v.
c. Let

d. Show how to compute all articulation points in O(E) time.
e. Prove that an edge of G is a bridge if and only if it does not lie on any simple cycle of
G.
f. Show how to compute all the bridges of G in O(E) time.
g. Prove that the biconnected components of G partition the nonbridge edges of G.
