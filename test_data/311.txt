Exercises 15.5-3
Suppose that instead of maintaining the table w[i, j], we computed the value of w(i, j) directly
from equation (15.17) in line 8 of OPTIMAL-BST and used this computed value in line 10.
How would this change affect the asymptotic running time of OPTIMAL-BST?

Exercises 15.5-4: ⋆
Knuth [184] has shown that there are always roots of optimal subtrees such that root[i, j - 1] ≤
root[i, j] ≤ root[i + 1, j] for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Use this fact to modify the OPTIMAL-BST
procedure to run in Θ(n2) time.

Problems 15-1: Bitonic euclidean traveling-salesman problem
The euclidean traveling-salesman problem is the problem of determining the shortest closed
tour that connects a given set of n points in the plane. Figure 15.9(a) shows the solution to a 7point problem. The general problem is NP-complete, and its solution is therefore believed to
require more than polynomial time (see Chapter 34).
