Problems 3-1: Asymptotic behavior of polynomials
Let

where ad > 0, be a degree-d polynomial in n, and let k be a constant. Use the definitions of the
asymptotic notations to prove the following properties.
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.

If k ≥ d, then p(n) = O(nk).
If k ≤ d, then p(n) = Ω(nk).
If k = d, then p(n) = Θ(nk).
If k > d, then p(n) = o(nk).
If k < d, then p(n) = ω(nk).
