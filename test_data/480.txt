trees in GA, and each iteration reduces that number by 1. When the forest contains only a
single tree, the algorithm terminates.
The two algorithms in Section 23.2 use the following corollary to Theorem 23.1.
Corollary 23.2
Let G = (V, E) be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w defined
on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, and let C
= (VC, EC) be a connected component (tree) in the forest GA = (V, A). If (u, v) is a light edge
connecting C to some other component in GA, then (u, v) is safe for A.
Proof The cut (VC, V - VC) respects A, and (u, v) is a light edge for this cut. Therefore, (u, v) is
safe for A.

Exercises 23.1-1
Let (u, v) be a minimum-weight edge in a graph G. Show that (u, v) belongs to some
minimum spanning tree of G.

Exercises 23.1-2
Professor Sabatier conjectures the following converse of Theorem 23.1. Let G = (V, E) be a
connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w defined on E. Let A be a
subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, let (S, V - S) be any cut of
G that respects A, and let (u, v) be a safe edge for A crossing (S, V - S). Then, (u, v) is a light
edge for the cut. Show that the professor's conjecture is incorrect by giving a counterexample.

Exercises 23.1-3
Show that if an edge (u, v) is contained in some minimum spanning tree, then it is a light edge
crossing some cut of the graph.

Exercises 23.1-4
Give a simple example of a graph such that the set of edges {(u, v) : there exists a cut (S, V S) such that (u, v) is a light edge crossing (S, V - S)} does not form a minimum spanning tree.
