Let us define an essential term to be one of the eight terms appearing on the right-hand side
of one of the equations (28.9)–(28.12). We have now used 4 products to compute the two
submatrices s and t whose essential terms are af, bh, ce, and dg. Note that P1 computes the
essential term af, P2 computes the essential term bh, P3 computes the essential term ce, and P4
computes the essential term dg. Thus, it remains for us to compute the remaining two
submatrices r and u, whose essential terms are ae, bg, cf, and dh, without using more than 3
additional products. We now try the innovation P5 in order to compute two essential terms at
once:
P5 = A5B5
= (a + d) · (e + h)
= ae + ah + de + dh

In addition to computing both of the essential terms ae and dh, P5 computes the inessential
terms ah and de, which need to be canceled somehow. We can use P4 and P2 to cancel them,
but two other inessential terms then appear:

By adding an additional product

however, we obtain
