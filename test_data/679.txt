algorithm in Section 29.3. Instead, we take an algebraic view. We first write the given linear
program in slack form, which is a set of linear equalities. These linear equalities will express
some of the variables, called "basic variables," in terms of other variables, called "nonbasic
variables." Moving from one vertex to another will be accomplished by making a basic
variable become nonbasic and making a nonbasic variable become basic. This operation is
called a "pivot" and, viewed algebraically, is nothing more than a rewriting of the linear
program in an equivalent slack form.
The two-variable example described above was a particularly simple one. We shall need to
address several more details in this chapter. These issues include identifying linear programs
that have no solutions, linear programs that have no finite optimal solution, and linear
programs for which the origin is not a feasible solution.

An intuitive definition of a convex region is that it fulfills the requirement that for any two
points in the region, all points on a line segment between them are also in the region.
Applications of linear programming
Linear programming has a large number of applications. Any textbook on operations research
is filled with examples of linear programming, and it is now a standard tool taught to students
in most business schools. The election scenario is one typical example. Two more examples
of linear programming are the following:
•

An airline wishes to schedule its flight crews. The Federal Aviation Administration
imposes many constraints, such as limiting the number of consecutive hours that each
crew member can work and insisting that a particular crew work only on one model of
aircraft during each month. The airline wants to schedule crews on all of its flights
using as few crew members as possible.
An oil company wants to decide where to drill for oil. Siting a drill at a particular
location has an associated cost and, based on geological surveys, an expected payoff
of some number of barrels of oil. The company has a limited budget for locating new
drills and wants to maximize the amount of oil it expects to find, given this budget.

Linear programs also are useful for modeling and solving graph and combinatorial problems,
such as ones that appear in this textbook. We have already seen a special case of linear
programming used to solve systems of difference constraints in Section 24.4. In Section 29.2,
we shall study how to formulate several graph and network-flow problems as linear programs.
In Section 35.4, we shall use linear programming as a tool to find an approximate solution to
another graph problem.

29.1 Standard and slack forms
This section describes two formats, standard form and slack form, that will be useful in
specifying and working with linear programs. In standard form, all the constraints are
inequalities, whereas in slack form, the constraints are equalities.
