Problems 30-5: Polynomial evaluation at multiple points
We have observed that the problem of evaluating a polynomial of degree-bound n - 1 at a
single point can be solved in O(n) time using Horner's rule. We have also discovered that such
a polynomial can be evaluated at all n complex roots of unity in O(n lg n) time using the FFT.
We shall now show how to evaluate a polynomial of degree-bound n at n arbitrary points in
O(n lg2 n) time.
To do so, we shall use the fact that we can compute the polynomial remainder when one such
polynomial is divided by another in O(n lg n) time, a result that we assume without proof. For
example, the remainder of 3x3 + x2 - 3x + 1 when divided by x2 + x + 2 is
(3x3 + x2 - 3x + 1) mod (x2 + x + 2) = -7x + 5.
Given the coefficient representation of a polynomial
and n points x0, x1,..., xn-1,
we wish to compute the n values A(x0), A(x1),...,(A(xn-1). For 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n - 1, define the
