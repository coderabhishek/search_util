Figure 31.6: Digital signatures in a public-key system. Alice signs the message M′ by
appending her digital signature Σ = SA(M′) to it. She transmits the message/signature pair (M′,
Σ) to Bob, who verifies it by checking the equation M′ = PA(Σ). If the equation holds, he
accepts (M′, Σ) as a message that has been signed by Alice.

Alice computes her digital signature Σ for the message M′ using her secret key SA and
the equation Σ = SA(M′).
Alice sends the message/signature pair (M′, Σ) to Bob.
When Bob receives (M′, Σ), he can verify that it originated from Alice by using Alice's
public key to verify the equation M′ = PA(Σ). (Presumably, M′ contains Alice's name,
so Bob knows whose public key to use.) If the equation holds, then Bob concludes that
the message M′ was actually signed by Alice. If the equation doesn't hold, Bob
concludes either that the message M′ or the digital signature Σ was corrupted by
transmission errors or that the pair (M′, Σ) is an attempted forgery.

Because a digital signature provides both authentication of the signer's identity and
authentication of the contents of the signed message, it is analogous to a handwritten signature
at the end of a written document.
An important property of a digital signature is that it is verifiable by anyone who has access to
the signer's public key. A signed message can be verified by one party and then passed on to
other parties who can also verify the signature. For example, the message might be an
electronic check from Alice to Bob. After Bob verifies Alice's signature on the check, he can
give the check to his bank, who can then also verify the signature and effect the appropriate
funds transfer.
We note that a signed message is not encrypted; the message is "in the clear" and is not
protected from disclosure. By composing the above protocols for encryption and for
signatures, we can create messages that are both signed and encrypted. The signer first
appends his digital signature to the message and then encrypts the resulting message/signature
pair with the public key of the intended recipient. The recipient decrypts the received message
with his secret key to obtain both the original message and its digital signature. He can then
verify the signature using the public key of the signer. The corresponding combined process
using paper-based systems is to sign the paper document and then seal the document inside a
paper envelope that is opened only by the intended recipient.
The RSA cryptosystem
In the RSA public-key cryptosystem, a participant creates his public and secret keys with the
following procedure.
1. Select at random two large prime numbers p and q such that p ≠ q. The primes p and q
might be, say, 512 bits each.
2. Compute n by the equation n = pq.
