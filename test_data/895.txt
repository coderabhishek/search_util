Give an efficient greedy algorithm that finds an optimal vertex cover for a tree in linear time.

Exercises 35.1-5
From the proof of Theorem 34.12, we know that the vertex-cover problem and the NPcomplete clique problem are complementary in the sense that an optimal vertex cover is the
complement of a maximum-size clique in the complement graph. Does this relationship imply
that there is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a constant approximation ratio
for the clique problem? Justify your answer.

35.2 The traveling-salesman problem
In the traveling-salesman problem introduced in Section 34.5.4, we are given a complete
undirected graph G = (V, E) that has a nonnegative integer cost c(u, v) associated with each
edge (u, v) E, and we must find a hamiltonian cycle (a tour) of G with minimum cost. As an
extension of our notation, let c(A) denote the total cost of the edges in the subset A E:

In many practical situations, it is always cheapest to go directly from a place u to a place w;
going by way of any intermediate stop v can't be less expensive. Putting it another way,
cutting out an intermediate stop never increases the cost. We formalize this notion by saying
that the cost function c satisfies the triangle inequality if for all vertices u, v, w V,
c(u, w) â‰¤ c(u, v) + c(v, w).
The triangle inequality is a natural one, and in many applications it is automatically satisfied.
For example, if the vertices of the graph are points in the plane and the cost of traveling
between two vertices is the ordinary euclidean distance between them, then the triangle
inequality is satisfied. (There are many cost functions other than euclidean distance that
satisfy the triangle inequality.)
As Exercise 35.2-2 shows, the traveling-salesman problem is NP-complete even if we require
that the cost function satisfy the triangle inequality. Thus, it is unlikely that we can find a
polynomial-time algorithm for solving this problem exactly. We therefore look instead for
good approximation algorithms.
In Section 35.2.1, we examine a 2-approximation algorithm for the traveling-salesman
problem with the triangle inequality. In Section 35.2.2, we show that without the triangle
inequality, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a constant approximation ratio
does not exist unless P = NP.

Applying the methodology of the previous section, we will first compute a structure-a
minimum spanning tree-whose weight is a lower bound on the length of an optimal traveling-
