Alice wishes to sign a message M, she first applies h to M to obtain the fingerprint h(M),
which she then encrypts with her secret key. She sends (M, SA(h(M))) to Bob as her signed
version of M. Bob can verify the signature by computing h(M) and verifying that PA applied
to SA(h(M)) as received equals h(M). Because no one can create two messages with the same
fingerprint, it is computationally infeasible to alter a signed message and preserve the validity
of the signature.
Finally, we note that the use of certificates makes distributing public keys much easier. For
example, assume there is a "trusted authority" T whose public key is known by everyone.
Alice can obtain from T a signed message (her certificate) stating that "Alice's public key is
PA." This certificate is "self-authenticating" since everyone knows PT. Alice can include her
certificate with her signed messages, so that the recipient has Alice's public key immediately
available in order to verify her signature. Because her key was signed by T, the recipient
knows that Alice's key is really Alice's.
Exercises 31.7-1
Consider an RSA key set with p = 11, q = 29, n = 319, and e = 3. What value of d should be
used in the secret key? What is the encryption of the message M = 100?

Exercises 31.7-2
Prove that if Alice's public exponent e is 3 and an adversary obtains Alice's secret exponent d,
then the adversary can factor Alice's modulus n in time polynomial in the number of bits in n.
(Although you are not asked to prove it, you may be interested to know that this result
remains true even if the condition e = 3 is removed. See Miller [221].)

Exercises 31.7-3:
Prove that RSA is multiplicative in the sense that
PA(M1) PA(M2) â‰¡ PA(M1 M2) (mod n).
Use this fact to prove that if an adversary had a procedure that could efficiently decrypt 1
percent of messages from Zn encrypted with PA, then he could employ a probabilistic
algorithm to decrypt every message encrypted with PA with high probability.

Primality testing

In this section, we consider the problem of finding large primes. We begin with a discussion
of the density of primes, proceed to examine a plausible (but incomplete) approach to
primality testing, and then present an effective randomized primality test due to Miller and
Rabin.
