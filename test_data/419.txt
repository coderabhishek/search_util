be in the root list-it can be any node at all.) We shall show that size(x) is exponential in
degree[x]. Bear in mind that degree[x] is always maintained as an accurate count of the
degree of x.
Lemma 20.1
Let x be any node in a Fibonacci heap, and suppose that degree[x] = k. Let y1, y2, . . . , yk
denote the children of x in the order in which they were linked to x, from the earliest to the
latest. Then, degree[y1] ≥ 0 and degree[yi] ≥ i - 2 for i = 2, 3, . . . , k.
Proof Obviously, degree[y1] ≥ 0.
For i ≥ 2, we note that when yi was linked to x, all of y1, y2, . . . , yi-1 were children of x, so we
must have had degree[x] = i - 1. Node yi is linked to x only if degree[x] = degree[yi], so we
must have also had degree[yi] = i - 1 at that time. Since then, node yi has lost at most one
child, since it would have been cut from x if it had lost two children. We conclude that
degree[yi ] ≥ i - 2.

We finally come to the part of the analysis that explains the name "Fibonacci heaps." Recall
from Section 3.2 that for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , the kth Fibonacci number is defined by the
recurrence

The following lemma gives another way to express Fk.
Lemma 20.2
For all integers k ≥ 0,

Proof The proof is by induction on k. When k = 0,

We now assume the inductive hypothesis that
