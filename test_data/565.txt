Exercises 26.2-3
In the example of Figure 26.5, what is the minimum cut corresponding to the maximum flow
shown? Of the augmenting paths appearing in the example, which two cancel flow?

Exercises 26.2-4
Prove that for any pair of vertices u and v and any capacity and flow functions c and f, we
have cf(u, v) + cf(v, u) = c(u, v) + c(v, u).

Exercises 26.2-5
Recall that the construction in Section 26.1 that converts a multisource, multisink flow
network into a single-source, single-sink network adds edges with infinite capacity. Prove that
any flow in the resulting network has a finite value if the edges of the original multisource,
multisink network have finite capacity.

Exercises 26.2-6
Suppose that each source si in a multisource, multisink problem produces exactly pi units of
flow, so that f(si, V) = pi. Suppose also that each sink tj consumes exactly qj units, so that f(V,
tj) = qj, where Σi pi = Σj qj. Show how to convert the problem of finding a flow f that obeys
these additional constraints into the problem of finding a maximum flow in a single-source,
single-sink flow network.
