The term "binomial tree" comes from property 3 of Lemma 19.1, since the terms
binomial coefficients. Exercise 19.1-3 gives further justification for the term.

19.1.2 Binomial heaps
A binomial heap H is a set of binomial trees that satisfies the following binomial-heap
properties.
1. Each binomial tree in H obeys the min-heap property: the key of a node is greater
than or equal to the key of its parent. We say that each such tree is min-heap-ordered.
2. For any nonnegative integer k, there is at most one binomial tree in H whose root has
degree k.
The first property tells us that the root of a min-heap-ordered tree contains the smallest key in
the tree.
The second property implies that an n-node binomial heap H consists of at most ⌊lgn⌋ + 1
binomial trees. To see why, observe that the binary representation of n has ⌊lg n⌋ + 1 bits, say
b⌊lg n⌋, b⌊lg n⌋-1, ..., b0 , so that
. By property 1 of Lemma 19.1, therefore,
binomial tree Bi appears in H if and only if bit bi = 1. Thus, binomial heap H contains at most
⌊lg n⌋ + 1 binomial trees.
Figure 19.3(a) shows a binomial heap H with 13 nodes. The binary representation of 13 is
1101 , and H consists of min-heap-ordered binomial trees B3, B2, and B0, having 8, 4, and 1
nodes respectively, for a total of 13 nodes.

Figure 19.3: A binomial heap H with n = 13 nodes. (a) The heap consists of binomial trees B0,
B2, and B3, which have 1, 4, and 8 nodes respectively, totaling n = 13 nodes. Since each
binomial tree is min-heap-ordered, the key of any node is no less than the key of its parent.
Also shown is the root list, which is a linked list of roots in order of increasing degree. (b) A
more detailed representation of binomial heap H . Each binomial tree is stored in the leftchild, right-sibling representation, and each node stores its degree.
