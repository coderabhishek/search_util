Exercises 30.1-2
Evaluating a polynomial A(x) of degree-bound n at a given point x0 can also be done by
dividing A(x) by the polynomial (x - x0) to obtain a quotient polynomial q(x) of degree-bound
n - 1 and a remainder r, such that
A(x) = q(x)(x - x0) + r.
Clearly, A(x0) = r. Show how to compute the remainder r and the coefficients of q(x) in time
Θ(n) from x0 and the coefficients of A.

Exercises 30.1-3
Derive a point-value representation for
for
, assuming that none of the points is 0.

from a point-value representation

Exercises 30.1-4
Prove that n distinct point-value pairs are necessary to uniquely specify a polynomial of
degree-bound n, that is, if fewer than n distinct point-value pairs are given, they fail to specify
a unique polynomial of degree-bound n. (Hint: Using Theorem 30.1, what can you say about
a set of n - 1 point-value pairs to which you add one more arbitrarily-chosen point-value
pair?)

Exercises 30.1-5
Show how to use equation (30.5) to interpolate in time Θ(n2). (Hint: First compute the
coefficient representation of the polynomial Πj(x - xj) and then divide by (x - xk) as necessary
for the numerator of each term; see Exercise 30.1-2. Each of the n denominators can be
computed in time O(n).)

Exercises 30.1-6
Explain what is wrong with the "obvious" approach to polynomial division using a pointvalue representation, i.e., dividing the corresponding y values. Discuss separately the case in
which the division comes out exactly and the case in which it doesn't.
