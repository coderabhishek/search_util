Fundamental theorem of linear programming
We conclude this chapter by showing that the SIMPLEX procedure works. In particular, any
linear program either is infeasible, is unbounded, or has an optimal solution with a finite
objective value, and in each case, SIMPLEX will act appropriately.
Theorem 29.13: (Fundamental theorem of linear programming)
Any linear program L, given in standard form, either
1. has an optimal solution with a finite objective value,
2. is infeasible, or
3. is unbounded.
If L is infeasible, SIMPLEX returns "infeasible." If L is unbounded, SIMPLEX returns
"unbounded." Otherwise, SIMPLEX returns an optimal solution with a finite objective value.

Proof By Lemma 29.12, if linear program L is infeasible, then SIMPLEX returns "infeasible."
Now suppose that the linear program L is feasible. By Lemma 29.12, INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX
returns a slack form for which the basic solution is feasible. By Lemma 29.7, therefore,
SIMPLEX either returns "unbounded" or terminates with a feasible solution. If it terminates
with a finite solution, then Theorem 29.10 tells us that this solution is optimal. On the other
hand, if SIMPLEX returns "un-bounded," Lemma 29.2 tells us the linear program L is indeed
unbounded. Since SIMPLEX always terminates in one of these ways, the proof is complete.
Exercises 29.5-1
Give detailed pseudocode to implement lines 5 and 11 of INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX.

Exercises 29.5-2
Show that when INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX runs the main loop of SIMPLEX, "unbounded" will
never be returned.
