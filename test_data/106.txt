We approximate by integrals to bound this summation from above and below. By the
inequalities (A.12), we have

Evaluating these definite integrals gives us the bounds

which provide a rather tight bound for Pr {S}. Because we wish to maximize our probability
of success, let us focus on choosing the value of k that maximizes the lower bound on Pr {S}.
(Besides, the lower-bound expression is easier to maximize than the upper-bound expression.)
Differentiating the expression (k/n)(ln n - ln k) with respect to k, we obtain

Setting this derivative equal to 0, we see that the lower bound on the probability is maximized
when ln k = ln n - 1 = ln(n/e) or, equivalently, when k = n/e. Thus, if we implement our
strategy with k = n/e, we will succeed in hiring our best-qualified applicant with probability at
least 1/e.
Exercises 5.4-1
How many people must there be in a room before the probability that someone has the same
birthday as you do is at least 1/2? How many people must there be before the probability that
at least two people have a birthday on July 4 is greater than 1/2?

Exercises 5.4-2
Suppose that balls are tossed into b bins. Each toss is independent, and each ball is equally
likely to end up in any bin. What is the expected number of ball tosses before at least one of
the bins contains two balls?
