In this section, let a denote the subgroup of generated by a by repeated multiplication,
and let ordn(a) (the "order of a, modulo n") denote the order of a in . For example, 2 =
{1, 2, 4} in , and ord7(2) = 3. Using the definition of the Euler phi function φ(n) as the size
of (see Section 31.3), we now translate Corollary 31.19 into the notation of to obtain
Euler's theorem and specialize it to , where p is prime, to obtain Fermat's theorem.
Theorem 31.30: (Euler's theorem)
For any integer n > 1,

Theorem 31.31: (Fermat's theorem)
If p is prime, then

Proof By equation (31.20), φ(p) = p - 1 if p is prime.

This corollary applies to every element in Zp except 0, since
we have ap ≡ a (mod p) if p is prime.

. For all a

Zp, however,

If
, then every element in is a power of g, modulo n, and we say that g is a
primitive root or a generator of . For example, 3 is a primitive root, modulo 7, but 2 is not a
primitive root, modulo 7. If possesses a primitive root, we say that the group is cyclic. We
omit the proof of the following theorem, which is proven by Niven and Zuckerman [231].
Theorem 31.32
The values of n > 1 for which
positive integers e.

is cyclic are 2, 4, pe, and 2pe, for all primes p > 2 and all

If g is a primitive root of and a is any element of , then there exists a z such that gz ≡ a
(mod n). This z is called the discrete logarithm or index of a, modulo n, to the base g; we
denote this value as indn,g(a).
