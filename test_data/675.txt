of urban, suburban, or rural voters who could be won over by spending $1,000 on advertising
support of a policy on a particular issue. Negative entries denote votes that would be lost.
By trial and error, it is possible to come up with a strategy that will win the required number
of votes, but such a strategy may not be the least expensive one. For example, you could
devote $20,000 of advertising to building roads, $0 to gun control, $4,000 to farm subsidies,
and $9,000 to a gasoline tax. In this case, you would win 20(-2) + 0(8) + 4(0) + 9(10) = 50
thousand urban votes, 20(5)+0(2)+4(0)+9(0) = 100 thousand suburban votes, and 20(3)+0(5)+4(10)+9(-2) = 82 thousand rural votes. You would win the exact number of votes desired
in the urban and suburban areas and more than enough votes in the rural area. (In fact, in the
rural area, you have gotten more votes than there are voters!) In order to garner these votes,
you would have paid for 20+0+4+9 = 33 thousand dollars of advertising.
Naturally, you may wonder if your strategy was the best possible. That is, could you have
achieved your goals while spending less on advertising? Additional trial and error may help
you to answer this question, but you would rather have a systematic method for answering
such questions. In order to do so, we shall formulate this question mathematically. We
introduce 4 variables:
•
•
•
•

x1 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on building roads,
x2 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on gun control,
x3 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on farm subsidies, and
x4 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on a gasoline tax.

We can write the requirement that we win at least 50,000 urban votes as
(29.1)
Similarly, we can write the requirements that we win at least 100,000 suburban votes and
25,000 rural votes as
(29.2)
and
(29.3)
Any setting of the variables x1, x2, x3, x4 so that inequalities (29.1)-(29.3) are satisfied is a
strategy that will win a sufficient number of each type of vote. In order to keep costs as small
as possible, we would like to minimize the amount spent on advertising. That is, we would
like to minimize the expression
(29.4)
Although negative advertising is a common occurrence in political campaigns, there is no
such thing as negative-cost advertising. Consequently, we require that
