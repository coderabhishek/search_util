denote the matrix of values of the basis functions at the given points; that is, aij = fj(xi). Let c =
(ck) denote the desired size-n vector of coefficients. Then,

is the size-m vector of "predicted values" for y. Thus,
η = Ac - y
is the size-m vector of approximation errors.
To minimize approximation errors, we choose to minimize the norm of the error vector η,
which gives us a least-squares solution, since

Since

we can minimize
result to 0:

η

with respect to each ck and then setting the

The n equations (28.32) for k = 1, 2, . . . , n are equivalent to the single matrix equation
(Ac - y)T A = 0
or, equivalently (using Exercise 28.1-2), to
AT(Ac - y) = 0,
which implies
