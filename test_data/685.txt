For example, in the slack form

we have B = {1, 2, 4}, N = {3, 5, 6},

c = c3 c5 c6)T = (-1/6 -1/6 -2/3)T, and v = 28. Note that the indices into A, b, and c are not
necessarily sets of contiguous integers; they depend on the index sets B and N. As an example
of the entries of A being the negatives of the coefficients as they appear in the slack form,
observe that the equation for x1 includes the term x3/6, yet the coefficient a13 is actually -1/6
rather than +1/6.
