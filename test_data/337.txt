Theoretical foundations for greedy methods

There is a beautiful theory about greedy algorithms, which we sketch in this section. This
theory is useful in determining when the greedy method yields optimal solutions. It involves
combinatorial structures known as "matroids." Although this theory does not cover all cases
for which a greedy method applies (for example, it does not cover the activity-selection
problem of Section 16.1 or the Huffman coding problem of Section 16.3), it does cover many
cases of practical interest. Furthermore, this theory is being rapidly developed and extended to
cover many more applications; see the notes at the end of this chapter for references.
Matroids
A matroid is an ordered pair M = (S,ℓ) satisfying the following conditions.
1. S is a finite nonempty set.
2. ℓ is a nonempty family of subsets of S, called the independent subsets of S, such that
if B ℓ and A B, then A ℓ. We say thatℓ is hereditary if it satisfies this property.
Note that the empty set Ø is necessarily a member ofℓ.
3. If A ℓ, B ℓ, and |A| < |B|, then there is some element x B - A such that A {x}
ℓ. We say that M satisfies the exchange property.
The word "matroid" is due to Hassler Whitney. He was studying matric matroids, in which
the elements of S are the rows of a given matrix and a set of rows is independent if they are
linearly independent in the usual sense. It is easy to show that this structure defines a matroid
(see Exercise 16.4-2).
As another example of matroids, consider the graphic matroid MG = (SG,ℓG) defined in terms
of a given undirected graph G = (V, E) as follows.

The set SG is defined to be E, the set of edges of G.
If A is a subset of E, then A ℓG if and only if A is acyclic. That is, a set of edges A is
independent if and only if the subgraph GA = (V, A) forms a forest.

The graphic matroid MG is closely related to the minimum-spanning-tree problem, which is
covered in detail in Chapter 23.
Theorem 16.5
If G = (V, E) is an undirected graph, then MG = (SG,ℓG) is a matroid.
Proof Clearly, SG = E is a finite set. Furthermore,ℓG is hereditary, since a subset of a forest is
a forest. Putting it another way, removing edges from an acyclic set of edges cannot create
cycles.
Thus, it remains to show that MG satisfies the exchange property. Suppose that GA = (V, A)
and GB = (V, B) are forests of G and that |B| >; |A|. That is, A and B are acyclic sets of edges,
and B contains more edges than A does.
