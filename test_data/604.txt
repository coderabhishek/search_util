Exercises 27.1-4
Prove that any sorting network on n inputs has depth at least lg n.

Exercises 27.1-5
Prove that the number of comparators in any sorting network is Ω(n lg n).

Exercises 27.1-6
Consider the comparison network shown in Figure 27.3. Prove that it is in fact a sorting
network, and describe how its structure is related to that of insertion sort (Section 2.1).

Figure 27.3: A sorting network based on insertion sort for use in Exercise 27.1-6.
Exercises 27.1-7
We can represent an n-input comparison network with c comparators as a list of c pairs of
integers in the range from 1 to n. If two pairs contain an integer in common, the order of the
corresponding comparators in the network is determined by the order of the pairs in the list.
Given this representation, describe an O(n + c)-time (serial) algorithm for determining the
depth of a comparison network.

Exercises 27.1-8:
Suppose that in addition to the standard kind of comparator, we introduce an "upside-down"
comparator that produces its minimum output on the bottom wire and its maximum output on
the top wire. Show how to convert any sorting network that uses a total of c standard and
upside-down comparators to one that uses c standard ones. Prove that your conversion method
is correct.
