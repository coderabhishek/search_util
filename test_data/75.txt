where i is a positive integer. Then T(n) can be bounded asymptotically for exact powers of b
as follows.
1. If
for some constant > 0, then
.
2. If
, then
.
3. If
for some constant > 0, and if af (n/b) ≤ cf(n) for some constant c <
1 and all sufficiently large n, then T(n) = Θ(f(n)).
Proof We use the bounds in Lemma 4.3 to evaluate the summation (4.6) from Lemma 4.2.
For case 1, we have
T(n) =
=

,

and for case 2,
T(n) =
=

.

For case 3,
T(n) =
= Θ(f(n)),
because

4.4.2 Floors and ceilings
To complete the proof of the master theorem, we must now extend our analysis to the
situation in which floors and ceilings are used in the master recurrence, so that the recurrence
is defined for all integers, not just exact powers of b. Obtaining a lower bound on
(4.10)
and an upper bound on
(4.11)
is routine, since the bound ⌈n/b⌉ ≥ n/b can be pushed through in the first case to yield the
desired result, and the bound ⌊n/b⌋ ≤ n/b can be pushed through in the second case. Lower
bounding the recurrence (4.11) requires much the same technique as upper bounding the
recurrence (4.10), so we shall present only this latter bound.
