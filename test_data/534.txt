used in the shortest-paths algorithms correspond to in regular matrix multiplication?

Exercises 25.1-4
Show that matrix multiplication defined by EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS is associative.

Exercises 25.1-5
Show how to express the single-source shortest-paths problem as a product of matrices and a
vector. Describe how evaluating this product corresponds to a Bellman-Ford-like algorithm
(see Section 24.1).

Exercises 25.1-6
Suppose we also wish to compute the vertices on shortest paths in the algorithms of this
section. Show how to compute the predecessor matrix Π from the completed matrix L of
shortest-path weights in O(n3) time.

Exercises 25.1-7
The vertices on shortest paths can also be computed at the same time as the shortest-path
weights. Let us define
to be the predecessor of vertex j on any minimum-weight path from
i to j that contains at most m edges. Modify EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS and SLOWALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATHS to compute the matrices Π(1), Π(2),..., Π(n-1) as the matrices
L(1), L(2),..., L(n-1) are computed.

Exercises 25.1-8
The FASTER-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATHS procedure, as written, requires us to store
⌈lg(n - 1)⌉ matrices, each with n2 elements, for a total space requirement of Θ(n2 lg n).
Modify the procedure to require only Θ(n2) space by using only two n × n matrices.
