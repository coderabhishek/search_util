Proof We use the nomenclature from Lemma 26.10. Suppose that M is a maximum matching
in G and that the corresponding flow f in G' is not maximum. Then there is a maximum flow f'
in G' such that |f'| > |f|. Since the capacities in G' are integer-valued, by Theorem 26.11, we
can assume that f' is integer-valued. Thus, f' corresponds to a matching M' in G with
cardinality |M'| = |f'| > |f| = |M|, contradicting our assumption that M is a maximum matching.
In a similar manner, we can show that if f is a maximum flow in G', its corresponding
matching is a maximum matching on G.

Thus, given a bipartite undirected graph G, we can find a maximum matching by creating the
flow network G', running the Ford-Fulkerson method, and directly obtaining a maximum
matching M from the integer-valued maximum flow f found. Since any matching in a bipartite
graph has cardinality at most min(L, R) = O(V), the value of the maximum flow in G' is O(V).
We can therefore find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph in time O(V E') = O(V E),
since |E'| = Î˜(E).
Exercises 26.3-1
Run the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on the flow network in Figure 26.8(b) and show the
residual network after each flow augmentation. Number the vertices in L top to bottom from 1
to 5 and in R top to bottom from 6 to 9. For each iteration, pick the augmenting path that is
lexicographically smallest.

Exercise 26.3-2
Prove Theorem 26.11.

Exercise 26.3-3
Let G = (V, E) be a bipartite graph with vertex partition V = L R, and let G' be its
corresponding flow network. Give a good upper bound on the length of any augmenting path
found in G' during the execution of FORD-FULKERSON.

Exercise 26.3-4:
A perfect matching is a matching in which every vertex is matched. Let G = (V, E) be an
undirected bipartite graph with vertex partition V = L R, where |L| = |R|. For any X V,
define the neighborhood of X as
