31.4 Solving modular linear equations
We now consider the problem of finding solutions to the equation
(31.21)
where a > 0 and n > 0. There are several applications for this problem; for example, we will
use it as part of the procedure for finding keys in the RSA public-key cryptosystem in Section
31.7. We assume that a, b, and n are given, and we are to find all values of x, modulo n, that
satisfy equation (31.21). There may be zero, one, or more than one such solution.
Let a denote the subgroup of Zn generated by a. Since a = {a(x) : x > 0} = {ax mod n :
x > 0}, equation (31.21) has a solution if and only if b
a . Lagrange's theorem (Theorem
31.15) tells us that | a | must be a divisor of n. The following theorem gives us a precise
characterization of a .
