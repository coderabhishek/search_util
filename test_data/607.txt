Exercises 27.2-1
Prove that applying a monotonically increasing function to a sorted sequence produces a
sorted sequence.

Exercises 27.2-2
Prove that a comparison network with n inputs correctly sorts the input sequence n, n - 1,...,
1 if and only if it correctly sorts the n - 1 zero-one sequences 1, 0, 0,..., 0, 0 , 1, 1, 0,...,
0, 0 ,..., 1, 1, 1,..., 1, 0 .

Exercises 27.2-3
Use the zero-one principle to prove that the comparison network shown in Figure 27.6 is a
sorting network.

Figure 27.6: A sorting network for sorting 4 numbers.
Exercises 27.2-4
State and prove an analog of the zero-one principle for a decision-tree model. (Hint: Be sure
to handle equality properly.)

Exercises 27.2-5
Prove that an n-input sorting network must contain at least one comparator between the ith
and (i + 1)st lines for all i = 1, 2,..., n - 1.
