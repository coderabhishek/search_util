Polynomials
A polynomial in the variable x over an algebraic field F is a representation of a function A(x)
as a formal sum:

We call the values a0, a1,..., an-1 the coefficients of the polynomial. The coefficients are drawn
from a field F, typically the set C of complex numbers. A polynomial A(x) is said to have
degree k if its highest nonzero coefficient is ak. Any integer strictly greater than the degree of
a polynomial is a degree-bound of that polynomial. Therefore, the degree of a polynomial of
degree-bound n may be any integer between 0 and n - 1, inclusive.
There are a variety of operations we might wish to define for polynomials. For polynomial
addition, if A(x) and B(x) are polynomials of degree-bound n, we say that their sum is a
polynomial C(x), also of degree-bound n, such that C(x) = A(x) + B(x) for all x in the
underlying field. That is, if

and

then

where cj = aj + bj for j = 0, 1,..., n - 1. For example, if we have the polynomials A(x) = 6x3 +
7x2 - 10x + 9 and B(x) = -2x3 + 4x - 5, then C(x) = 4x3 + 7x2 - 6x + 4.
For polynomial multiplication, if A(x) and B(x) are polynomials of degree-bound n, we say
that their product C(x) is a polynomial of degree-bound 2n - 1 such that C(x) = A(x) B(x) for
all x in the underlying field. You probably have multiplied polynomials before, by multiplying
each term in A(x) by each term in B(x) and combining terms with equal powers. For example,
we can multiply A(x) = 6x3 + 7x2 - 10x + 9 and B(x) = -2x3 + 4x - 5 as follows:

Another way to express the product C(x) is
