The associated basic solution is (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4) = (4, 0, 0, 6, 0), which is feasible. We now
repeatedly call PIVOT until we obtain an optimal solution to Laux. In this case, one call to
PIVOT with x2 entering and x0 leaving yields

This slack form is the final solution to the auxiliary problem. Since this solution has x0 = 0,
we know that our initial problem was feasible. Furthermore, since x0 = 0, we can just remove
it from the set of constraints. We can then use the original objective function, with appropriate
substitutions made to include only nonbasic variables. In our example, we get the objective
function

Setting x0 = 0 and simplifying, we get the objective function

and the slack form

This slack form has a feasible basic solution, and we can return it to procedure SIMPLEX.
We now formally show the correctness of INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX.
Lemma 29.12
If a linear program L has no feasible solution, then INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX returns
"infeasible." Otherwise, it returns a valid slack form for which the basic solution is feasible.
Proof First suppose that the linear program L has no feasible solution. Then by Lemma 29.11,
the optimal objective value of Laux, defined in (29.109)â€“(29.111), is nonzero, and by the
nonnegativity constraint on x0, an optimal solution must have a negative objective value.
Furthermore, this objective value must be finite, since setting xi = 0, for i = 1, 2, ..., n, and
is feasible, and this solution has objective value
. Therefore, line 9 of
INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX will find a solution with a negative objective value. Let be the basic
solution associated with the final slack form. We cannot have
, because then Laux would
