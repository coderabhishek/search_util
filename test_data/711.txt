29.5 The initial basic feasible solution
In this section, we first describe how to test if a linear program is feasible, and if it is, how to
produce a slack form for which the basic solution is feasible. We conclude by proving the
fundamental theorem of linear programming, which says that the SIMPLEX procedure always
produces the correct result.
Finding an initial solution
In Section 29.3, we assumed that we had a procedure INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX that determines
whether a linear program has any feasible solutions, and if it does, gives a slack form for
which the basic solution is feasible. We describe this procedure here.
A linear program can be feasible, yet the initial basic solution may not be feasible. Consider,
for example, the following linear program:
(29.105)
subject to
(29.106)
(29.107)
(29.108)
If we were to convert this linear program to slack form, the basic solution would set x1 = 0
and x2 = 0. This solution violates constraint (29.107), and so it is not a feasible solution. Thus,
INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX cannot just return the obvious slack form. By inspection, it is not
clear whether this linear program even has any feasible solutions. In order to determine
whether it does, we can formulate an auxiliary linear program. For this auxiliary linear
program, we will be able to find (with a little work) a slack form for which the basic solution
is feasible. Furthermore, the solution of this auxiliary linear program will determine whether
the initial linear program is feasible and if so, it will provide a feasible solution with which we
can initialize SIMPLEX.
