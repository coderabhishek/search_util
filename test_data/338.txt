It follows from Theorem B.2 that a forest having k edges contains exactly |V|-k trees. (To
prove this another way, begin with |V| trees, each consisting of a single vertex, and no edges.
Then, each edge that is added to the forest reduces the number of trees by one.) Thus, forest
GA contains |V| - |A| trees, and forest GB contains |V| - |B| trees.
Since forest GB has fewer trees than forest GA does, forest GB must contain some tree T whose
vertices are in two different trees in forest GA. Moreover, since T is connected, it must contain
an edge (u, v) such that vertices u and v are in different trees in forest GA. Since the edge (u, v)
connects vertices in two different trees in forest GA, the edge (u, v) can be added to forest GA
without creating a cycle. Therefore, MG satisfies the exchange property, completing the proof
that MG is a matroid.

Given a matroid M = (S,ℓ), we call an element x ∉ A an extension of A ℓ if x can be added
to A while preserving independence; that is, x is an extension of A if A {x} ℓ. As an
example, consider a graphic matroid MG. If A is an independent set of edges, then edge e is an
extension of A if and only if e is not in A and the addition of e to A does not create a cycle.
If A is an independent subset in a matroid M, we say that A is maximal if it has no extensions.
That is, A is maximal if it is not contained in any larger independent subset of M. The
following property is often useful.
Theorem 16.6
All maximal independent subsets in a matroid have the same size.
Proof Suppose to the contrary that A is a maximal independent subset of M and there exists
another larger maximal independent subset B of M. Then, the exchange property implies that
A is extendible to a larger independent set A {x} for some x B - A, contradicting the
assumption that A is maximal.

As an illustration of this theorem, consider a graphic matroid MG for a connected, undirected
graph G. Every maximal independent subset of MG must be a free tree with exactly |V| - 1
edges that connects all the vertices of G. Such a tree is called a spanning tree of G.
We say that a matroid M = (S,ℓ) is weighted if there is an associated weight function w that
assigns a strictly positive weight w(x) to each element x S. The weight function w extends
to subsets of S by summation:

for any A S. For example, if we let w(e) denote the length of an edge e in a graphic matroid
MG, then w(A) is the total length of the edges in edge set A.
