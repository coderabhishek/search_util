Next, we show how to convert a linear program in which some of the variables do not have
nonnegativity constraints into one in which each variable has a non-negativity constraint.
Suppose that some variable xj does not have a nonnegativity constraint. Then we replace each
occurrence of xj by
, and add the non-negativity constraints
and
. Thus, if the
objective function has a term cjxj , it is replaced by
, and if constraint i has a term
aijxj, it is replaced by
. Any feasible solution x to the new linear program corresponds
to a feasible solution to the original linear program with
and with the same objective
value, and thus the two solutions are equivalent. We apply this conversion scheme to each
variable that does not have a nonnegativity constraint to yield an equivalent linear program in
which all variables have non-negativity constraints.
Continuing the example, we want to ensure that each variable has a corresponding
nonnegativity constraint. Variable x1 has such a constraint, but variable x2 does not. Therefore,
we replace x2 by two variables and , and we modify the linear program to obtain

subject to
(29.22)

Next, we convert equality constraints into inequality constraints. Suppose that a linear
program has an equality constraint f (x1, x2, ..., xn) = b. Since x = y if and only if both x ≥ y and
x ≤ y, we can replace this equality constraint by the pair of inequality constraints f (x1, x2, ...,
xn) ≤ b and f (x1, x2, ..., xn) ≥ b. Repeating this conversion for each equality constraint yields a
linear program in which all constraints are inequalities.
Finally, we can convert the greater-than-or-equal-to constraints to less-than-or-equalconstraints by multiplying these constraints through by -1. That is, any inequality of the form

is equivalent to

Thus, by replacing each coefficient aij by -aij and each value bi by -bi, we obtain an equivalent
less-than-or-equal-to constraint.
Finishing our example, we replace the equality in constraint (29.22) by two inequalities,
obtaining
