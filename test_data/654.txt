The 0's in the first and second matrices of the factorization are row and column vectors,
respectively, of size n - 1. The term vwT/a11, formed by taking the outer product of v and w
and dividing each element of the result by a11, is an (n - 1) × (n - 1) matrix, which conforms in
size to the matrix A′ from which it is subtracted. The resulting (n - 1) × (n - 1) matrix
(28.23)
is called the Schur complement of A with respect to a11.
We claim that if A is nonsingular, then the Schur complement is nonsingular, too. Why?
Suppose that the Schur complement, which is (n - 1) × (n - 1), is singular. Then by Theorem
28.1, it has row rank strictly less than n - 1. Because the bottom n - 1 entries in the first
column of the matrix

are all 0, the bottom n - 1 rows of this matrix must have row rank strictly less than n - 1. The
row rank of the entire matrix, therefore, is strictly less than n. Applying Exercise 28.1-10 to
equation (28.22), A has rank strictly less than n, and from Theorem 28.1 we derive the
contradiction that A is singular.
Because the Schur complement is nonsingular, we can now recursively find an LU
decomposition of it. Let us say that
A′ - vwT/a11 = L′U′,
where L′ is unit lower-triangular and U′ is upper-triangular. Then, using matrix algebra, we
have

thereby providing our LU decomposition. (Note that because L′ is unit lower-triangular, so is
L, and because U′ is upper-triangular, so is U.)
Of course, if a11 = 0, this method doesn't work, because it divides by 0. It also doesn't work if
the upper leftmost entry of the Schur complement A′ - vwT/a11 is 0, since we divide by it in the
next step of the recursion. The elements by which we divide during LU decomposition are
called pivots, and they occupy the diagonal elements of the matrix U. The reason we include a
permutation matrix P during LUP decomposition is that it allows us to avoid dividing by zero
elements. Using permutations to avoid division by 0 (or by small numbers) is called pivoting.
An important class of matrices for which LU decomposition always works correctly is the
class of symmetric positive-definite matrices. Such matrices require no pivoting, and thus the
