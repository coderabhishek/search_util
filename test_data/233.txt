(12.3)

(Exercise 12.4-1 asks you to prove this identity.)
For the base case, we verify that the bound

holds. For the substitution, we have that

We have bounded E[Yn], but our ultimate goal is to bound E[Xn]. As Exercise 12.4-4 asks you
to show, the function f(x) = 2x is convex (see page 1109). Therefore, we can apply Jensen's
inequality (C.25), which says that

to derive that

Taking logarithms of both sides gives E[Xn] = O(lg n). Thus, we have proven the following:
Theorem 12.4
The expected height of a randomly built binary search tree on n keys is O(lg n).
