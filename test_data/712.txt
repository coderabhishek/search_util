Let L be a linear program in standard form, given as in (29.16)–(29.18). Let Laux be the
following linear program with n + 1 variables:
(29.109)
subject to
(29.110)
(29.111)
Then L is feasible if and only if the optimal objective value of Laux is 0.
. Then the solution
Proof Suppose that L has a feasible solution
combined with is a feasible solution to Laux with objective value 0. Since x0 ≥ 0 is a constraint
of Laux and the objective function is to maximize -x0, this solution must be optimal for Laux.
Conversely, suppose that the optimal objective value of Laux is 0. Then
of the remaining variables satisfy the constraints of L.

, and the values

We now describe our strategy to find an initial basic feasible solution for a linear program L
in standard form:

▹Is the initial basic solution feasible?
if bl ≥ 0
then return ({1, 2, ..., n}, {n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + m}, A, b, c,

form Laux by adding -x0 to the left-hand side of each equation
and setting the objective function to -x0
let (N, B, A, b, c, v) be the resulting slack form for Laux

▹ Laux has n + 1 nonbasic variables and m basic variables.
(N, B, A, b, c, v) ← PIVOT(N, B, A, b, c, v, l, 0)

9 iterate the while loop of lines 2–11 of SIMPLEX until an optimal
solution
to Laux is found
10 if the basic solution sets

then return the final slack form with x0 removed and
the original objective function restored

else return "infeasible"

INITIALIZE-SIMPLEX works as follows. In lines 1–3, we implicitly test the basic solution
to the initial slack form for L given by N = {1, 2, ..., n}, B = {n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + m},
for all i B, and
for all j N. (Creating the slack form requires no explicit effort, as the
values of A, b, and c are the same in both slack and standard forms.) If this basic solution is
feasible—that is,
for all i N B—then the slack form is returned. Otherwise, in line
4, we form the auxiliary linear program Laux as in Lemma 29.11. Since the initial basic
solution to L is not feasible, the initial basic solution to the slack form for Laux will not be
