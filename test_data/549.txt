Before seeing an example of a network-flow problem, let us briefly explore the three flow
properties. The capacity constraint simply says that the flow from one vertex to another must
not exceed the given capacity. Skew symmetry is a notational convenience that says that the
flow from a vertex u to a vertex v is the negative of the flow in the reverse direction. The
flow-conservation property says that the total flow out of a vertex other than the source or
sink is 0. By skew symmetry, we can rewrite the flow-conservation property as

for all v

V - {s, t}. That is, the total flow into a vertex is 0.

When neither (u, v) nor (v, u) is in E, there can be no flow between u and v, and f(u, v) = f(v,
u) = 0. (Exercise 26.1-1 asks you to prove this property formally.)
Our last observation concerning the flow properties deals with flows that are positive. The
total positive flow entering a vertex v is defined by
(26.2)

The total positive flow leaving a vertex is defined symmetrically. We define the total net flow
at a vertex to be the total positive flow leaving a vertex minus the total positive flow entering
a vertex. One interpretation of the flow-conservation property is that the total positive flow
entering a vertex other than the source or sink must equal the total positive flow leaving that
vertex. This property, that the total net flow at a vertex must equal 0, is often informally
referred to as "flow in equals flow out."
An example of flow
A flow network can model the trucking problem shown in Figure 26.1(a). The Lucky Puck
Company has a factory (source s) in Vancouver that manufactures hockey pucks, and it has a
warehouse (sink t) in Winnipeg that stocks them. Lucky Puck leases space on trucks from
another firm to ship the pucks from the factory to the warehouse. Because the trucks travel
over specified routes (edges) between cities (vertices) and have a limited capacity, Lucky
Puck can ship at most c(u, v) crates per day between each pair of cities u and v in Figure
26.1(a). Lucky Puck has no control over these routes and capacities and so cannot alter the
flow network shown in Figure 26.1(a). Their goal is to determine the largest number p of
crates per day that can be shipped and then to produce this amount, since there is no point in
producing more pucks than they can ship to their warehouse. Lucky Puck is not concerned
with how long it takes for a given puck to get from the factory to the warehouse; they care
only that p crates per day leave the factory and p crates per day arrive at the warehouse.
On the surface, it seems appropriate to model the "flow" of shipments with a flow in this
network because the number of crates shipped per day from one city to another is subject to a
capacity constraint. Additionally, flow conservation must be obeyed, for in a steady state, the
rate at which pucks enter an intermediate city must equal the rate at which they leave.
Otherwise, crates would accumulate at intermediate cities.
