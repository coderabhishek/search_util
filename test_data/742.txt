Prove that there are infinitely many primes. (Hint: how that none of the primes p1, p2, ..., pk
divide (p1 p2 ··· pk) + 1.)

Exercises 31.1-2
Prove that if a | b and b | c, then a | c.

Exercises 31.1-3
Prove that if p is prime and 0 < k < p, then gcd(k, p) = 1.

Exercises 31.1-4
Prove Corollary 31.5.

Exercises 31.1-5
Prove that if p is prime and 0 < k < p, then
primes p,

. Conclude that for all integers a, b, and

(a + b)p ≡ ap + bp (mod p).

Exercises 31.1-6
Prove that if a and b are any integers such that a | b and b > 0, then
(x mod b) mod a = x mod a
for any x. Prove, under the same assumptions, that
x ≡ y mod b) implies x ≡ y (mod a)
for any integers x and y.
