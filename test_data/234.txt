Exercises 12.4-1
Prove equation (12.3).

Exercises 12.4-2
Describe a binary search tree on n nodes such that the average depth of a node in the tree is
Θ(lg n) but the height of the tree is w(lg n). Give an asymptotic upper bound on the height of
an n-node binary search tree in which the average depth of a node is Θ(lg n).

Exercises 12.4-3
Show that the notion of a randomly chosen binary search tree on n keys, where each binary
search tree of n keys is equally likely to be chosen, is different from the notion of a randomly
built binary search tree given in this section. (Hint: List the possibilities when n = 3.)

Exercises 12.4-4
Show that the function f(x) = 2x is convex.

Exercises 12.4-5:
Consider RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT operating on a sequence of n input numbers. Prove
that for any constant k > 0, all but O(1/nk) of the n! input permutations yield an O(n lg n)
running time.

Problems 12-1: Binary search trees with equal keys
Equal keys pose a problem for the implementation of binary search trees.
a. What is the asymptotic performance of TREE-INSERT when used to insert n items
with identical keys into an initially empty binary search tree?
