U is an upper-triangular matrix, and
P is a permutation matrix.

We call matrices L, U , and P satisfying equation (28.19) an LUP decomposition of the matrix
A. We shall show that every nonsingular matrix A possesses such a decomposition.
The advantage of computing an LUP decomposition for the matrix A is that linear systems can
be solved more readily when they are triangular, as is the case for both matrices L and U .
Having found an LUP decomposition for A, we can solve the equation (28.17) Ax = b by
solving only triangular linear systems, as follows. Multiplying both sides of Ax = b by P
yields the equivalent equation P Ax = Pb, which by Exercise 28.1-5 amounts to permuting the
equations (28.16).Using our decomposition (28.19), we obtain
LU x = Pb.
We can now solve this equation by solving two triangular linear systems. Let us define y = U
x, where x is the desired solution vector. First, we solve the lower-triangular system
(28.20)
for the unknown vector y by a method called "forward substitution." Having solved for y, we
then solve the upper-triangular system
(28.21)
for the unknown x by a method called "back substitution." The vector x is our solution to Ax =
b, since the permutation matrix P is invertible (Exercise 28.1-5):
Ax = P-1LU x
= P-1Ly
= P-1Pb
= b.
Our next step is to show how forward and back substitution work and then attack the problem
of computing the LUP decomposition itself.
Forward and back substitution
Forward substitution can solve the lower-triangular system (28.20) in Θ(n2) time, given L, P,
and b. For convenience, we represent the permutation P compactly by an array π[1 n]. For i
= 1, 2, . . . , n, the entry π[i] indicates that Pi, π[i] = 1 and Pij = 0 for j ≠ π[i]. Thus, P A has aπ[i], j
in row i and column j, and Pb has bπ[i] as its ith element. Since L is unit lower-triangular,
equation (28.20) can be rewritten as
y1
l21y1 + y2
l31y1 + l32y2 + y3

= bπ[1],
= bπ[2],
= bπ[3],
