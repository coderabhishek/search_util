Exercises 24.4-7
Show how a system of difference constraints can be solved by a Bellman-Ford-like algorithm
that runs on a constraint graph without the extra vertex v0.

Exercises 24.4-8: ⋆
Let Ax ≤ b be a system of m difference constraints in n unknowns. Show that the Bellmansubject to
Ford algorithm, when run on the corresponding constraint graph, maximizes
Ax ≤ b and xi ≤ 0 for all xi.

Exercises 24.4-9: ⋆
Show that the Bellman-Ford algorithm, when run on the constraint graph for a system Ax ≤ b
of difference constraints, minimizes the quantity (max {xi} - min {xi}) subject to Ax ≤ b.
Explain how this fact might come in handy if the algorithm is used to schedule construction
jobs.

Exercises 24.4-10
Suppose that every row in the matrix A of a linear program Ax ≤ b corresponds to a difference
constraint, a single-variable constraint of the form xi ≤ bk, or a single-variable constraint of the
form -xi ≤ bk. Show how to adapt the Bellman-Ford algorithm to solve this variety of
constraint system.

Exercises 24.4-11
Give an efficient algorithm to solve a system Ax ≤ b of difference constraints when all of the
elements of b are real-valued and all of the unknowns xi must be integers.
