Prove that the flows in a network form a convex set. That is, show that if f1 and f2 are flows,
then so is αf1 + (1 - α) f2 for all α in the range 0 ≤ α ≤ 1.

Exercises 26.1-8
State the maximum-flow problem as a linear-programming problem.

Exercises 26.1-9
Professor Adam has two children who, unfortunately, dislike each other. The problem is so
severe that not only do they refuse to walk to school together, but in fact each one refuses to
walk on any block that the other child has stepped on that day. The children have no problem
with their paths crossing at a corner. Fortunately both the professor's house and the school are
on corners, but beyond that he is not sure if it is going to be possible to send both of his
children to the same school. The professor has a map of his town. Show how to formulate the
problem of determining if both his children can go to the same school as a maximum-flow
problem.

26.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method
This section presents the Ford-Fulkerson method for solving the maximum-flow problem. We
call it a "method" rather than an "algorithm" because it encompasses several implementations
with differing running times. The Ford-Fulkerson method depends on three important ideas
that transcend the method and are relevant to many flow algorithms and problems: residual
networks, augmenting paths, and cuts. These ideas are essential to the important max-flow
min-cut theorem (Theorem 26.7), which characterizes the value of a maximum flow in terms
of cuts of the flow network. We end this section by presenting one specific implementation of
the Ford-Fulkerson method and analyzing its running time.
The Ford-Fulkerson method is iterative. We start with f(u, v) = 0 for all u, v V, giving an
initial flow of value 0. At each iteration, we increase the flow value by finding an
"augmenting path," which we can think of simply as a path from the source s to the sink t
along which we can send more flow, and then augmenting the flow along this path. We repeat
this process until no augmenting path can be found. The max-flow min-cut theorem will show
that upon termination, this process yields a maximum flow.
