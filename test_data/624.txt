whose solution is D(n) = lg n.

Figure 27.9: The comparison network BITONIC-SORTER[n], shown here for n = 8. (a) The
recursive construction: HALF-CLEANER[n] followed by two copies of BITONICSORTER[n/2] that operate in parallel. (b) The network after unrolling the recursion. Each
half-cleaner is shaded. Sample zero-one values are shown on the wires.
Thus, a zero-one bitonic sequence can be sorted by BITONIC-SORTER, which has a depth of
lg n. It follows by the analog of the zero-one principle given as Exercise 27.3-6 that any
bitonic sequence of arbitrary numbers can be sorted by this network.
Exercises 27.3-1
How many zero-one bitonic sequences of length n are there?

Exercises 27.3-2
Show that BITONIC-SORTER[n], where n is an exact power of 2, contains Î˜(n lg n)
comparators.

Exercises 27.3-3
Describe how an O(lg n)-depth bitonic sorter can be constructed when the number n of inputs
is not an exact power of 2.

Exercises 27.3-4
If the input to a half-cleaner is a bitonic sequence of arbitrary numbers, prove that the output
satisfies the following properties: both the top half and the bottom half are bitonic, and every
element in the top half is at least as small as every element in the bottom half.
