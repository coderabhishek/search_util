Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with source vertex s, and let G be initialized by
INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s). Prove that if a sequence of relaxation steps sets π[s]
to a non-NIL value, then G contains a negative-weight cycle.

Exercises 24.5-5
Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with no negative-weight edges. Let s V be the
source vertex, and suppose that we allow π[v] to be the predecessor of v on any shortest path
to v from source s if v V - {s} is reachable from s, and NIL otherwise. Give an example of
such a graph G and an assignment of π values that produces a cycle in Gπ . (By Lemma 24.16,
such an assignment cannot be produced by a sequence of relaxation steps.)

Exercises 24.5-6
Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w : E → R and no
negative-weight cycles. Let s V be the source vertex, and let G be initialized by
INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s). Prove that for every vertex v Vπ, there exists a path
from s to v in Gπ and that this property is maintained as an invariant over any sequence of
relaxations.

Exercises 24.5-7
Let G = (V, E) be a weighted, directed graph that contains no negative-weight cycles. Let s
V be the source vertex, and let G be initialized by INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s).
Prove that there exists a sequence of |V | - 1 relaxation steps that produces d[v] = δ(s, v) for all
v V.

Exercises 24.5-8
Let G be an arbitrary weighted, directed graph with a negative-weight cycle reachable from
the source vertex s. Show that an infinite sequence of relaxations of the edges of G can always
be constructed such that every relaxation causes a shortest-path estimate to change.
