Figure 26.8: The flow network corresponding to a bipartite graph. (a) The bipartite graph G =
(V, E) with vertex partition V = L R from Figure 26.7. A maximum matching is shown by
shaded edges. (b) The corresponding flow network G' with a maximum flow shown. Each
edge has unit capacity. Shaded edges have a flow of 1, and all other edges carry no flow. The
shaded edges from L to R correspond to those in a maximum matching of the bipartite graph.
To complete the construction, we assign unit capacity to each edge in E'. Since each vertex in
V has at least one incident edge, |E| ≥ |V|/2. Thus, |E| ≤ |E'| = |E| + |V| ≤ 3|E|, and so |E'| = Θ(E).
The following lemma shows that a matching in G corresponds directly to a flow in G's
corresponding flow network G'. We say that a flow f on a flow network G = (V, E) is integervalued if f (u, v) is an integer for all (u, v) V × V.
Lemma 26.10
Let G = (V, E) be a bipartite graph with vertex partition V = L R, and let G' = (V', E') be its
corresponding flow network. If M is a matching in G, then there is an integer-valued flow f in
G' with value |f| = |M|. Conversely, if f is an integer-valued flow in G', then there is a matching
M in G with cardinality |M| = |f|.
Proof We first show that a matching M in G corresponds to an integer-valued flow in G'.
Define f as follows. If (u, v) M, then f (s, u) = f (u, v) = f(v, t) = 1 and f(u, s) = f(v, u) = f(t, v)
= -1. For all other edges (u, v) E', we define f(u, v) = 0. It is simple to verify that f satisfies
skew symmetry, the capacity constraints, and flow conservation.
Intuitively, each edge (u, v) M corresponds to 1 unit of flow in G' that traverses the path s
→ u → v → t. Moreover, the paths induced by edges in M are vertex-disjoint, except for s and
t. The net flow across cut (L {s}, R {t}) is equal to |M|; thus, by Lemma 26.5, the value
of the flow is |f| = |M|.
To prove the converse, let f be an integer-valued flow in G', and let
M = {(u, v) : u

L, v

R, and f(u, v) > 0}.

Each vertex u L has only one entering edge, namely (s, u), and its capacity is 1. Thus, each
u L has at most one unit of positive flow entering it, and if one unit of positive flow does
enter, by flow conservation, one unit of positive flow must leave. Furthermore, since f is
integer-valued, for each u L, the one unit of flow can enter on at most one edge and can
leave on at most one edge. Thus, one unit of positive flow enters u if and only if there is
exactly one vertex v R such that f(u, v) = 1, and at most one edge leaving each u L carries
