have objective value 0, contradicting the fact that the objective value is negative. Thus the test
in line 10 results in "infeasible" being returned in line 12.
Suppose now that the linear program L does have a feasible solution. From Exercise 29.3-3,
we know that if bi ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, ..., m, then the basic solution associated with the initial
slack form is feasible. In this case, lines 2–3 will return the slack form associated with the
input. (There is not much that has to be done to convert the standard form to slack form, since
A, b, and c are the same in both.)
In the remainder of the proof, we handle the case in which the linear program is feasible but
we do not return in line 3. We argue that in this case, lines 4–9 find a feasible solution to Laux
with objective value 0. First, by lines 1–2, we must have
bl < 0,
and
(29.115)
In line 7, we perform one pivot operation in which the leaving variable xl is the left-hand side
of the equation with minimum bi, and the entering variable is x0, the extra added variable. We
now show that after this pivot, all entries of b are nonnegative, and hence the basic solution to
Laux is feasible. Letting be the basic solution after the call to PIVOT, and letting and be
values returned by PIVOT, Lemma 29.1 implies that
(29.116)
The call to PIVOT in line 7 has e = 0, and by (29.110), we have that
(29.117)
(Note that ai0 is the coefficient of x0 as it appears in (29.110), not the negation of the
coefficient, because Laux is in standard rather than slack form.) Since l B, we also have that
. For the remaining basic variables, we have
ale = -1. Thus, bl/ale > 0, and so
(by equation (29.116))
= bi - aie(bl/ale) (by line 2 of PIVOT)
= bi - bl
(by equation (29.117) and ale = -1)
≥0
(by inequality (29.115)),
which implies that each basic variable is now nonnegative. Hence the basic solution after the
call to PIVOT in line 7 is feasible. We next execute line 9, which solves Laux. Since we have
assumed that L has a feasible solution, Lemma 29.11 implies that Laux has an optimal solution
with objective value 0. Since all the slack forms are equivalent, the final basic solution to Laux
must have
, and after removing x0 from the linear program, we obtain a slack form that is
feasible for L. This slack form is then returned in line 10.
