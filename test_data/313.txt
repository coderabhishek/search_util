There are six transformation operations:
•
•
•
•
•

•

Copy a character from x to z by setting z[j] ← x[i] and then incrementing both i and j.
This operation examines x[i].
Replace a character from x by another character c, by setting z[j] ← c, and then
incrementing both i and j. This operation examines x[i].
Delete a character from x by incrementing i but leaving j alone. This operation
examines x[i].
Insert the character c into z by setting z[j] ← c and then incrementing j, but leaving i
alone. This operation examines no characters of x.
Twiddle (i.e., exchange) the next two characters by copying them from x to z but in
the opposite order; we do so by setting z[j] ← x[i + 1] and z[j + 1] ← x[i] and then
setting i ← i + 2 and j ← j + 2. This operation examines x[i] and x[i + 1].
Kill the remainder of x by setting i ← m + 1. This operation examines all characters in
x that have not yet been examined. If this operation is performed, it must be the final
operation.

As an example, one way to transform the source string algorithm to the target string altruistic
is to use the following sequence of operations, where the underlined characters are x[i] and
z[j] after the operation:

Note that there are several other sequences of transformation operations that transform
algorithm to altruistic.
Each of the transformation operations has an associated cost. The cost of an operation
depends on the specific application, but we assume that each operation's cost is a constant that
is known to us. We also assume that the individual costs of the copy and replace operations
are less than the combined costs of the delete and insert operations; otherwise, the copy and
replace operations would not be used. The cost of a given sequence of transformation
