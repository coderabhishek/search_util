Corollary 31.3
For any integers a and b, if d | a and d | b then d | gcd(a, b).
Proof This corollary follows from equation (31.4), because gcd(a, b) is a linear combination
of a and b by Theorem 31.2.

Corollary 31.4
For all integers a and b and any nonnegative integer n,
gcd(an, bn) = n gcd(a, b).
Proof If n = 0, the corollary is trivial. If n > 0, then gcd(an, bn) is the smallest positive
element of the set {anx + bny}, which is n times the smallest positive element of the set {ax +
by}.

Corollary 31.5
For all positive integers n, a, and b, if n | ab and gcd(a, n) = 1, then n | b.
Proof The proof is left as Exercise 31.1-4.

Relatively prime integers
Two integers a, b are said to be relatively prime if their only common divisor is 1, that is, if
gcd(a, b) = 1. For example, 8 and 15 are relatively prime, since the divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4,
and 8, while the divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The following theorem states that if two
integers are each relatively prime to an integer p, then their product is relatively prime to p.
Theorem 31.6
For any integers a, b, and p, if both gcd(a, p) = 1 and gcd(b, p) = 1, then gcd(ab, p) = 1.
Proof It follows from Theorem 31.2 that there exist integers x, y, x′, and y′ such that
ax + py = 1 ,
bx′+ py′ = 1 .
