in which a2 runs first, followed by a1. Then c2 = 5, c1 = 8, and the average completion time
is (5 + 8)/2 = 6.5.
a. Give an algorithm that schedules the tasks so as to minimize the
average completion time. Each task must run non-preemptively, that
is, once task ai is started, it must run continuously for pi units of time.
Prove that your algorithm minimizes the average completion time,
and state the running time of your algorithm.
b. Suppose now that the tasks are not all available at once. That is,
each task has a release time ri before which it is not available to be
processed. Suppose also that we allow preemption, so that a task
can be suspended and restarted at a later time. For example, a task
ai with processing time pi = 6 may start running at time 1 and be
preempted at time 4. It can then resume at time 10 but be preempted
at time 11 and finally resume at time 13 and complete at time 15.
Task ai has run for a total of 6 time units, but its running time has
been divided into three pieces. We say that the completion time of ai
is 15. Give an algorithm that schedules the tasks so as to minimize
the average completion time in this new scenario. Prove that your
algorithm minimizes the average completion time, and state the
running time of your algorithm.

Problems 16-3: Acyclic subgraphs
a. Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph. Using the definition of a
matroid, show that (E,ℓ) is a matroid, where A ∈ℓ if and only if A is
an acyclic subset of E.
b. The incidence matrix for an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a |V | ×
|E| matrix M such that Mve = 1 if edge e is incident on vertex v, and
Mve = 0 otherwise. Argue that a set of columns of M is linearly
independent over the field of integers modulo 2 if and only if the
corresponding set of edges is acyclic. Then, use the result of

c.

Exercise 16.4-2 to provide an alternate proof that (E,ℓ) of part (a) is
matroid.
Suppose that a nonnegative weight w(e) is associated with each
edge in an undirected graph G = (V, E). Give an efficient algorithm to
find an acyclic subset of E of maximum total weight.

d. Let G(V, E) be an arbitrary directed graph, and let (E,ℓ) be defined so
that A ∈ℓ if and only if A does not contain any directed cycles. Give
an example of a directed graph G such that the associated system
(E,ℓ) is not a matroid. Specify which defining condition for a matroid
fails to hold.
e. The incidence matrix for a directed graph G = (V, E) is a |V |×|E|
matrix M such that Mve = -1 if edge e leaves vertex v, Mve = 1 if edge
e enters vertex v, and Mve = 0 otherwise. Argue that if a set of
columns of M is linearly independent, then the corresponding set of
edges does not contain a directed cycle.
f. Exercise 16.4-2 tells us that the set of linearly independent sets of
columns of any matrix M forms a matroid. Explain carefully why the
results of parts (d) and (e) are not contradictory. How can there fail to
be a perfect correspondence between the notion of a set of edges
being acyclic and the notion of the associated set of columns of the
incidence matrix being linearly independent?
