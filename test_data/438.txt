unchanged, then φq(x) = φq-1(x). If level(x) is unchanged and iter(x) increases, then it increases
by at least 1, and so φq(x) ≤ φq-1(x) - 1.
Finally, if the qth operation increases level(x), it increases by at least 1, so that the value of the
term (α(n) - level(x)) · rank[x] drops by at least rank[x]. Because level(x) increased, the value
of iter(x) might drop, but according to the bound (21.2), the drop is by at most rank[x] - 1.
Thus, the increase in potential due to the change in iter(x) is less than the decrease in potential
due to the change in level(x), and we conclude that φq(x) ≤ φq-1(x) - 1.

Our final three lemmas show that the amortized cost of each MAKE-SET, LINK, and FINDSET operation is O(α(n)). Recall from equation (17.2) that the amortized cost of each
operation is its actual cost plus the increase in potential due to the operation.
Lemma 21.10
The amortized cost of each MAKE-SET operation is O(1).
Proof Suppose that the qth operation is MAKE-SET(x). This operation creates node x with
rank 0, so that φq(x) = 0. No other ranks or potentials change, and so Φq = Φq-1. Noting that
the actual cost of the MAKE-SET operation is O(1) completes the proof.

Lemma 21.11
The amortized cost of each LINK operation is O(α(n)).
Proof Suppose that the qth operation is LINK(x, y). The actual cost of the LINK operation is
O(1). Without loss of generality, suppose that the LINK makes y the parent of x.
To determine the change in potential due to the LINK, we note that the only nodes whose
potentials may change are x, y, and the children of y just prior to the operation. We shall show
that the only node whose potential can increase due to the LINK is y, and that its increase is at
most α(n):
•
•

By Lemma 21.9, any node that is y's child just before the LINK cannot have its
potential increase due to the LINK.
From the definition of φq(x), we see that, since x was a root just before the qth
operation, φq-1(x) = α(n) · rank[x]. If rank[x] = 0, then φq(x) = φq-1(x) = 0. Otherwise,
φq(x) = (α(n) - level(x)) · rank[x] - iter(x)
< α(n) · rank[x] (by inequalities (21.1) and (21.2)).

•

Because this last quantity is φq-1(x), we see that x's potential decreases.
