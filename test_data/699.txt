An iteration of the while loop exchanges the role of a basic and a nonbasic variable.
The only operations performed involve solving equations and substituting one
equation into another, and therefore the slack form is equivalent to the one from the
previous iteration which, by the loop invariant, is equivalent to the initial slack form.
We now demonstrate the second part of the loop invariant. We assume that at the start
of each iteration of the while loop, bi ≥ 0 for each i B, and we shall show that that
these inequalities remain true after the call to PIVOT in line 11. Since the only
changes to the variables bi and the set B of basic variables occur in this assignment, it
suffices to show that line 11 maintains this part of the invariant. We let bi, aij, and B
refer to values before the call of PIVOT, and refer to values returned from PIVOT.
First, we observe that
SIMPLEX, and

because bl ≥ 0 by the loop invariant, ale > 0 by line 5 of
by line 2 of PIVOT.

For the remaining indices i

B - l, we have that

(29.79)

We have two cases to consider, depending on whether aie > 0 or aie ≤ 0. If aie > 0, then
since we chose l such that
(29.80)
we have
= bi - aie(bl/ale) (by equation (29.79))
≥ bi - aie(bi/aie) (by inequality (29.80))
= bi - bi
= 0,
. If aie = 0, then because ale, bi, and bl are all nonnegative, equation
and thus
(29.79) implies that must be nonnegative, too.
We now argue that the basic solution is feasible, i.e., that all variables have
nonnegative values. The nonbasic variables are set to 0 and thus are nonnegative. Each
basic variable xi is defined by the equation

The basic solution sets
. Using the second part of the loop invariant, we conclude
that each basic variable is nonnegative.

Termination: The while loop can terminate in one of two ways. If it terminates
because of the condition in line 2, then the current basic solution is feasible and this
solution is returned in line 16. The other way to terminate is to return "unbounded" in
line 10. In this case, for each iteration of the for loop in lines 4–7, when line 5 is
