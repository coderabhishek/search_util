Let f be a flow in a flow network G with source s and sink t, and let (S, T) be a cut of G. Then
the net flow across (S, T) is f(S, T) = |f|.
Proof Noting that f (S - s, V) = 0 by flow conservation, we have
f(S, T) = f (S, V) - f(S, S)

(by Lemma 26.1, part
(3))
(by Lemma 26.1, part
= f(S, V)
(1))
= f(s, V) + f(S - s, V) (by Lemma 26.1, part
(3))
= f(s, V)
(since f(S - s, V) = 0)
= |f|.

An immediate corollary to Lemma 26.5 is the result we proved earlier-equation (26.3)-that the
value of a flow is the total flow into the sink.
Another corollary to Lemma 26.5 shows how cut capacities can be used to bound the value of
a flow.
Corollary 26.6
The value of any flow f in a flow network G is bounded from above by the capacity of any cut
of G.
Proof Let (S, T) be any cut of G and let f be any flow. By Lemma 26.5 and the capacity
constraints,

An immediate consequence of Corollary 26.6 is that the maximum flow in a network is
bounded above by the capacity of a minimum cut of the network. The important max-flow
min-cut theorem, which we now state and prove, says that the value of a maximum flow is in
fact equal to the capacity of a minimum cut.
Theorem 26.7: (Max-flow min-cut theorem)
