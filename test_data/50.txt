where the constants a0, a1, ..., ad are the coefficients of the polynomial and ad ≠ 0. A
polynomial is asymptotically positive if and only if ad > 0. For an asymptotically positive
polynomial p(n) of degree d, we have p(n) = Θ(nd). For any real constant a ≥ 0, the function
na is monotonically increasing, and for any real constant a ≥ 0, the function na is
monotonically decreasing. We say that a function f(n) is polynomially bounded if f(n) = O(nk)
for some constant k.
Exponentials
For all real a > 0, m, and n, we have the following identities:
a0 = 1,
a1 = a,
a-1 = 1/a,
(am)n = amn,
(am)n = (an)m,
am an = am+n.
For all n and a ≥ 1, the function an is monotonically increasing in n. When convenient, we
shall assume 00 = 1.
The rates of growth of polynomials and exponentials can be related by the following fact. For
all real constants a and b such that a > 1,
(3.9)
from which we can conclude that
nb = o(an).
Thus, any exponential function with a base strictly greater than 1 grows faster than any
polynomial function.
Using e to denote 2.71828..., the base of the natural logarithm function, we have for all real x,

where "!" denotes the factorial function defined later in this section. For all real x, we have the
inequality
(3.11)
where equality holds only when x = 0. When |x| ≤ 1, we have the approximation
