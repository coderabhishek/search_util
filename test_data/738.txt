is composite because 3 | 39. The integer 1 is said to be a unit and is neither prime nor
composite. Similarly, the integer 0 and all negative integers are neither prime nor composite.
The division theorem, remainders, and modular equivalence
Given an integer n, the integers can be partitioned into those that are multiples of n and those
that are not multiples of n. Much number theory is based upon a refinement of this partition
obtained by classifying the nonmultiples of n according to their remainders when divided by
n. The following theorem is the basis for this refinement. The proof of this theorem will not
be given here (see, for example, Niven and Zuckerman [231]).
Theorem 31.1: (Division theorem)
For any integer a and any positive integer n, there are unique integers q and r such that 0 ≤ r <
n and a = qn + r.

The value q = ⌊a/n⌋ is the quotient of the division. The value r = a mod n is the remainder
(or residue) of the division. We have that n | a if and only if a mod n = 0.
The integers can be divided into n equivalence classes according to their remainders modulo
n. The equivalence class modulo n containing an integer a is
[a]n = {a + kn : k

Z}.

For example, [3]7 = {..., -11, -4, 3, 10, 17, ...}; other denotations for this set are [-4]7 and
[10]7. Using the notation defined on page 52, we can say that writing a [b]n is the same as
writing a ≡ b (mod n). The set of all such equivalence classes is
(31.1)
One often sees the definition
(31.2)
which should be read as equivalent to equation (31.1) with the understanding that 0 represents
[0]n, 1 represents [1]n, and so on; each class is represented by its least nonnegative element.
The underlying equivalence classes must be kept in mind, however. For example, a reference
to -1 as a member of Zn is a reference to [n - 1]n, since -1 ≡ n - 1 (mod n).
Common divisors and greatest common divisors
If d is a divisor of a and d is also a divisor of b, then d is a common divisor of a and b. For
example, the divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30, and so the common divisors of 24
and 30 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Note that 1 is a common divisor of any two integers.
An important property of common divisors is that
