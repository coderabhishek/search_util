It is important to realize that the three cases do not cover all the possibilities for f (n). There is
a gap between cases 1 and 2 when f (n) is smaller than
but not polynomially smaller.
Similarly, there is a gap between cases 2 and 3 when f (n) is larger than
but not
polynomially larger. If the function f (n) falls into one of these gaps, or if the regularity
condition in case 3 fails to hold, the master method cannot be used to solve the recurrence.
Using the master method
To use the master method, we simply determine which case (if any) of the master theorem
applies and write down the answer.
As a first example, consider
T (n) = 9T(n/3) + n.
For this recurrence, we have a = 9, b = 3, f (n) = n, and thus we have that
.
Since
, where = 1, we can apply case 1 of the master theorem and conclude
that the solution is T (n) = Θ(n2).
Now consider
T (n) = T (2n/3) + 1,
in which a = 1, b = 3/2, f (n) = 1, and
. Case 2 applies, since
, and thus the solution to the recurrence is T(n) = Θ(lg n).
For the recurrence
T(n) = 3T(n/4) + n lg n,
we have a = 3, b = 4, f (n) = n lg n, and

. Since

, where ≈ 0.2, case 3 applies if we can show that the regularity condition
holds for f (n). For sufficiently large n, af (n/b) = 3(n/4)lg(n/4) ≤ (3/4)n lg n = cf (n) for c =
3/4. Consequently, by case 3, the solution to the recurrence is T(n) = Θ(nlg n).
The master method does not apply to the recurrence
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n lg n,
even though it has the proper form: a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = n lg n, and
. It might seem that
case 3 should apply, since f (n) = n lg n is asymptotically larger than
. The problem is
that it is not polynomially larger. The ratio
is asymptotically less than
n for any positive constant . Consequently, the recurrence falls into the gap between case 2
and case 3. (See Exercise 4.4-2 for a solution.)
