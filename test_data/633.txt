is a 2 × 3 matrix A = (aij), where for i = 1, 2 and j = 1, 2, 3, the element of the matrix in row i
and column j is aij. We use uppercase letters to denote matrices and corresponding subscripted
lowercase letters to denote their elements. The set of all m × n matrices with real-valued
entries is denoted Rm×n. In general, the set of m × n matrices with entries drawn from a set S is
denoted Sm×n.
The transpose of a matrix A is the matrix AT obtained by exchanging the rows and columns of
A. For the matrix A of equation (28.1),

A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. For example,
(28.2)

is a vector of size 3. We use lowercase letters to denote vectors, and we denote the ith element
of a size-n vector x by xi , for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. We take the standard form of a vector to be as a
column vector equivalent to an n × 1 matrix; the corresponding row vector is obtained by
taking the transpose:
xT = (2 3 5).
The unit vector ei is the vector whose ith element is 1 and all of whose other elements are 0.
Usually, the size of a unit vector is clear from the context.
A zero matrix is a matrix whose every entry is 0. Such a matrix is often denoted 0, since the
ambiguity between the number 0 and a matrix of 0's is usually easily resolved from context. If
a matrix of 0's is intended, then the size of the matrix also needs to be derived from the
context.
Square n × n matrices arise frequently. Several special cases of square matrices are of
particular interest:
1. A diagonal matrix has aij = 0 whenever i ≠ j. Because all of the off-diagonal elements
are zero, the matrix can be specified by listing the elements along the diagonal:

2. The n × n identity matrix In is a diagonal matrix with 1's along the diagonal:
