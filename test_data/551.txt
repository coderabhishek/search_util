Figure 26.2: Converting a multiple-source, multiple-sink maximum-flow problem into a
problem with a single source and a single sink. (a) A flow network with five sources S = {s1,
s2, s3, s4, s5} and three sinks T = {t1, t2, t3}. (b) An equivalent single-source, single-sink flow
network. We add a supersource s and an edge with infinite capacity from s to each of the
multiple sources. We also add a supersink t and an edge with infinite capacity from each of
the multiple sinks to t.
We can reduce the problem of determining a maximum flow in a network with multiple
sources and multiple sinks to an ordinary maximum-flow problem. Figure 26.2(b) shows how
the network from (a) can be converted to an ordinary flow network with only a single source
and a single sink. We add a supersource s and add a directed edge (s, si) with capacity c(s, si)
= ∞ for each i = 1, 2, . . . , m. We also create a new supersink t and add a directed edge (ti, t)
with capacity c(ti, t) = ∞ for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Intuitively, any flow in the network in (a)
corresponds to a flow in the network in (b), and vice versa. The single source s simply
provides as much flow as desired for the multiple sources si, and the single sink t likewise
consumes as much flow as desired for the multiple sinks ti. Exercise 26.1-3 asks you to prove
formally that the two problems are equivalent.
Working with flows
We shall be dealing with several functions (like f) that take as arguments two vertices in a
flow network. In this chapter, we shall use an implicit summation notation in which either
argument, or both, may be a set of vertices, with the interpretation that the value denoted is
the sum of all possible ways of replacing the arguments with their members. For example, if X
and Y are sets of vertices, then

Thus, the flow-conservation constraint can be expressed as the condition that f(u, V) = 0 for
all u V - {s, t}. Also, for convenience, we shall typically omit set braces when they would
otherwise be used in the implicit summation notation. For example, in the equation f (s, V - s)
= f(s, V), the term V - s means the set V - {s}.
The implicit set notation often simplifies equations involving flows. The following lemma,
whose proof is left as Exercise 26.1-4, captures several of the most commonly occurring
identities that involve flows and the implicit set notation.
