Procedure LUP-SOLVE solves for y using forward substitution in lines 2–3, and then it solves
for x using backward substitution in lines 4–5. Since there is an implicit loop in the
summations within each of the for loops, the running time is Θ(n2).
As an example of these methods, consider the system of linear equations defined by

where

and we wish to solve for the unknown x. The LUP decomposition is

(The reader can verify that P A = LU.) Using forward substitution, we solve Ly = Pb for y:

obtaining

by computing first y1, then y2, and finally y3. Using back substitution, we solve U x = y for x:
