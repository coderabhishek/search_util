The second property follows directly from Lemma 24.16.
It remains, therefore, to prove the last property of shortest-paths trees: for each vertex v Vπ ,
the unique simple path
in Gπ is a shortest path from s to v in G. Let p = v0, v1,..., vk ,
where v0 = s and vk = v. For i = 1, 2,..., k, we have both d[vi ] = δ(s, vi) and d[vi] ≥ d[vi-1] +
w(vi-1, vi), from which we conclude w(vi-1, vi) ≤ δ(s, vi) - δ(s, vi-1). Summing the weights along
path p yields

Thus, w(p) ≤ δ(s, vk). Since δ(s, vk) is a lower bound on the weight of any path from s to vk, we
conclude that w(p) = δ(s, vk), and thus p is a shortest path from s to v = vk.

Exercises 24.5-1
Give two shortest-paths trees for the directed graph of Figure 24.2 other than the two shown.

Exercises 24.5-2
Give an example of a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E) with weight function w : E → R
and source s such that G satisfies the following property: For every edge (u, v) E, there is a
shortest-paths tree rooted at s that contains (u, v) and another shortest-paths tree rooted at s
that does not contain (u, v).

Exercises 24.5-3
Embellish the proof of Lemma 24.10 to handle cases in which shortest-path weights are ∞ or ∞.
