Later sections of this chapter will introduce additional uses for cross products. In Section
33.3, we shall need to sort a set of points according to their polar angles with respect to a
given origin. As Exercise 33.1-3 asks you to show, cross products can be used to perform the
comparisons in the sorting procedure. In Section 33.2, we shall use red-black trees to maintain
the vertical ordering of a set of line segments. Rather than keeping explicit key values, we
shall replace each key comparison in the red-black tree code by a cross-product calculation to
determine which of two segments that intersect a given vertical line is above the other.
Exercises 33.1-1
Prove that if p1 × p2 is positive, then vector p1 is clockwise from vector p2 with respect to the
origin (0, 0) and that if this cross product is negative, then p1 is counterclockwise from p2.

Exercises 33.1-2
Professor Powell proposes that only the x-dimension needs to be tested in line 1 of ONSEGMENT. Show why the professor is wrong.

Exercises 33.1-3
The polar angle of a point p1 with respect to an origin point p0 is the angle of the vector p1 p0 in the usual polar coordinate system. For example, the polar angle of (3, 5) with respect to
(2, 4) is the angle of the vector (1, 1), which is 45 degrees or π/4 radians. The polar angle of
(3, 3) with respect to (2, 4) is the angle of the vector (1, -1), which is 315 degrees or 7π/4
radians. Write pseudocode to sort a sequence p1, p2, ..., pn of n points according to their
polar angles with respect to a given origin point p0. Your procedure should take O(n lg n) time
and use cross products to compare angles.

Exercises 33.1-4
Show how to determine in O(n2 lg n) time whether any three points in a set of n points are
collinear.

Exercises 33.1-5
A polygon is a piecewise-linear, closed curve in the plane. That is, it is a curve ending on
itself that is formed by a sequence of straight-line segments, called the sides of the polygon. A
