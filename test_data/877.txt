The vertex-cover problem is to find a vertex cover of minimum size in a given graph.
Restating this optimization problem as a decision problem, we wish to determine whether a
graph has a vertex cover of a given size k. As a language, we define
VERTEX-COVER = { G, k

: graph G has a vertex cover of size k}.

The following theorem shows that this problem is NP-complete.
Theorem 34.12
The vertex-cover problem is NP-complete.
Proof We first show that VERTEX-COVER NP. Suppose we are given a graph G = (V, E)
and an integer k. The certificate we choose is the vertex cover V' V itself. The verification
algorithm affirms that |V'| = k, and then it checks, for each edge (u, v) E, that u V' or v
V'. This verification can be performed straightforwardly in polynomial time.
We prove that the vertex-cover problem is NP-hard by showing that CLIQUE ≤P VERTEXCOVER. This reduction is based on the notion of the "complement" of a graph. Given an
undirected graph G = (V, E), we define the complement of G as
, where
, and (u, v) ∉ E}. In other words, is the graph containing exactly those
edges that are not in G. Figure 34.15 shows a graph and its complement and illustrates the
reduction from CLIQUE to VERTEX-COVER.
The reduction algorithm takes as input an instance G, k of the clique problem. It computes
the complement , which is easily done in polynomial time. The output of the reduction
algorithm is the instance
, of the vertex-cover problem. To complete the proof, we
show that this transformation is indeed a reduction: the graph G has a clique of size k if and
only if the graph has a vertex cover of size |V | - k.
Suppose that G has a clique V'

V with |V'| = k. We claim that V - V' is a vertex cover in .

Let (u, v) be any edge in Ē. Then, (u, v) ∉ E, which implies that at least one of u or v does not
belong to V', since every pair of vertices in V' is connected by an edge of E. Equivalently, at
least one of u or v is in V - V', which means that edge (u, v) is covered by V - V'. Since (u, v)
