Draw the red-black tree that results after TREE-INSERT is called on the tree in Figure 13.1
with key 36. If the inserted node is colored red, is the resulting tree a red-black tree? What if it
is colored black?

Exercises 13.1-3
Let us define a relaxed red-black tree as a binary search tree that satisfies red- black
properties 1, 3, 4, and 5. In other words, the root may be either red or black. Consider a
relaxed red-black tree T whose root is red. If we color the root of T black but make no other
changes to T, is the resulting tree a red-black tree?

Exercises 13.1-4
Suppose that we "absorb" every red node in a red-black tree into its black parent, so that the
children of the red node become children of the black parent. (Ignore what happens to the
keys.) What are the possible degrees of a black node after all its red children are absorbed?
What can you say about the depths of the leaves of the resulting tree?

Exercises 13.1-5
Show that the longest simple path from a node x in a red-black tree to a descendant leaf has
length at most twice that of the shortest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf.

Exercises 13.1-6
What is the largest possible number of internal nodes in a red-black tree with black-height k?
What is the smallest possible number?

Exercises 13.1-7
Describe a red-black tree on n keys that realizes the largest possible ratio of red internal nodes
to black internal nodes. What is this ratio? What tree has the smallest possible ratio, and what
is the ratio?
