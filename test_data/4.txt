Despite myriad requests from students for solutions to problems and exercises, we have
chosen as a matter of policy not to supply references for problems and exercises, to remove
the temptation for students to look up a solution rather than to find it themselves.

Changes for the second edition
What has changed between the first and second editions of this book? Depending on how you
look at it, either not much or quite a bit.
A quick look at the table of contents shows that most of the first-edition chapters and sections
appear in the second edition. We removed two chapters and a handful of sections, but we have
added three new chapters and four new sections apart from these new chapters. If you were to
judge the scope of the changes by the table of contents, you would likely conclude that the
changes were modest.
The changes go far beyond what shows up in the table of contents, however. In no particular
order, here is a summary of the most significant changes for the second edition:

Cliff Stein was added as a coauthor.
Errors have been corrected. How many errors? Let's just say several.
There are three new chapters:
o Chapter 1 discusses the role of algorithms in computing.
o Chapter 5 covers probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. As in the
first edition, these topics appear throughout the book.
o Chapter 29 is devoted to linear programming.
Within chapters that were carried over from the first edition, there are new sections on
the following topics:
o perfect hashing (Section 11.5),
o two applications of dynamic programming (Sections 15.1 and 15.5), and
o approximation algorithms that use randomization and linear programming
(Section 35.4).
To allow more algorithms to appear earlier in the book, three of the chapters on
mathematical background have been moved from Part I to the Appendix, which is Part
VIII.
There are over 40 new problems and over 185 new exercises.
We have made explicit the use of loop invariants for proving correctness. Our first
loop invariant appears in Chapter 2, and we use them a couple of dozen times
throughout the book.
Many of the probabilistic analyses have been rewritten. In particular, we use in a
dozen places the technique of "indicator random variables," which simplify
probabilistic analyses, especially when random variables are dependent.
We have expanded and updated the chapter notes and bibliography. The bibliography
has grown by over 50%, and we have mentioned many new algorithmic results that
have appeared subsequent to the printing of the first edition.

We have also made the following changes:

The chapter on solving recurrences no longer contains the iteration method. Instead, in
Section 4.2, we have "promoted" recursion trees to constitute a method in their own
right. We have found that drawing out recursion trees is less error-prone than iterating
