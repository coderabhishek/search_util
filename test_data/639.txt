Also, for any square matrices A and B, we have det(AB) = det(A) det(B).

Theorem 28.5
An n × n matrix A is singular if and only if det(A) = 0.

Positive-definite matrices
Positive-definite matrices play an important role in many applications. An n × n matrix A is
positive-definite if xT Ax > 0 for all size-n vectors x ≠ 0. For example, the identity matrix is
positive-definite, since for any nonzero vector x = (x1 x2 · · · xn)T,

As we shall see, matrices that arise in applications are often positive-definite due to the
following theorem.
Theorem 28.6
For any matrix A with full column rank, the matrix AT A is positive-definite.
Proof We must show that xT(ATA)x > 0 for any nonzero vector x. For any vector x,
xT(ATA)x = (Ax)T(Ax) (by Exercise 28.1-2)
= Ax 2.
Note that Ax 2 is just the sum of the squares of the elements of the vector Ax. Therefore,
Ax 2 ≥ 0. If Ax 2 = 0, every element of Ax is 0, which is to say Ax = 0. Since A has full
column rank, Ax = 0 implies x = 0, by Theorem 28.2. Hence, AT A is positive-definite.

Other properties of positive-definite matrices will be explored in Section 28.5.
Exercises 28.1-1
Show that if A and B are symmetric n × n matrices, then so are A + B and A - B.
