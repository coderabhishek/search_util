31.7 The RSA public-key cryptosystem
A public-key cryptosystem can be used to encrypt messages sent between two communicating
parties so that an eavesdropper who overhears the encrypted messages will not be able to
decode them. A public-key cryptosystem also enables a party to append an unforgeable
"digital signature" to the end of an electronic message. Such a signature is the electronic
version of a handwritten signature on a paper document. It can be easily checked by anyone,
forged by no one, yet loses its validity if any bit of the message is altered. It therefore
provides authentication of both the identity of the signer and the contents of the signed
message. It is the perfect tool for electronically signed business contracts, electronic checks,
electronic purchase orders, and other electronic communications that must be authenticated.
The RSA public-key cryptosystem is based on the dramatic difference between the ease of
finding large prime numbers and the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime
numbers. Section 31.8 describes an efficient procedure for finding large prime numbers, and
Section 31.9 discusses the problem of factoring large integers.
Public-key cryptosystems
In a public-key cryptosystem, each participant has both a public key and a secret key. Each
key is a piece of information. For example, in the RSA cryptosystem,each key consists of a
pair of integers. The participants "Alice" and "Bob" are traditionally used in cryptography
examples; we denote their public and secret keys as PA, SA for Alice and PB, SB for Bob.
Each participant creates his own public and secret keys. Each keeps his secret key secret, but
he can reveal his public key to anyone or even publish it. In fact, it is often convenient to
assume that everyone's public key is available in a public directory, so that any participant can
easily obtain the public key of any other participant.
The public and secret keys specify functions that can be applied to any message. Let denote
the set of permissible messages. For example, might be the set of all finite-length bit
sequences. In the simplest, and original, formulation of public-key cryptography, we require
that the public and secret keys specify one-to-one functions from to itself. The function
corresponding to Alice's public key PA is denoted PA(), and the function corresponding to her
secret key SA is denoted SA(). The functions PA() and SA() are thus permutations of . We
assume that the functions PA() and SA() are efficiently computable given the corresponding
key PA or SA.
The public and secret keys for any participant are a "matched pair" in that they specify
functions that are inverses of each other. That is,
