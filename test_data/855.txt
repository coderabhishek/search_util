Show that if HAM-CYCLE P, then the problem of listing the vertices of a hamiltonian
cycle, in order, is polynomial-time solvable.

Exercises 34.2-4
Prove that the class NP of languages is closed under union, intersection, concatenation, and
Kleene star. Discuss the closure of NP under complement.

Exercises 34.2-5
Show that any language in NP can be decided by an algorithm running in time
constant k.

for some

Exercises 34.2-6
A hamiltonian path in a graph is a simple path that visits every vertex exactly once. Show
that the language HAM-PATH = { G, u, v : there is a hamiltonian path from u to v in graph
G} belongs to NP.

Exercises 34.2-7
Show that the hamiltonian-path problem can be solved in polynomial time on directed acyclic
graphs. Give an efficient algorithm for the problem.

Exercises 34.2-8
Let φ be a boolean formula constructed from the boolean input variables x1, x2, ..., xk,
negations (¬), AND's ( ), OR's ( ), and parentheses. The formula φ is a tautology if it
evaluates to 1 for every assignment of 1 and 0 to the input variables.Define TAUTOLOGY as
the language of boolean formulas that are tautologies. Show that TAUTOLOGY co-NP.
