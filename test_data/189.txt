Exercises 10.4-5:
Write an O(n)-time nonrecursive procedure that, given an n-node binary tree, prints out the
key of each node. Use no more than constant extra space outside of the tree itself and do not
modify the tree, even temporarily, during the procedure.

Exercises 10.4-6:
The left-child, right-sibling representation of an arbitrary rooted tree uses three pointers in
each node: left-child, right-sibling, and parent. From any node, its parent can be reached and
identified in constant time and all its children can be reached and identified in time linear in
the number of children. Show how to use only two pointers and one boolean value in each
node so that the parent of a node or all of its children can be reached and identified in time
linear in the number of children.

Problems 10-1: Comparisons among lists
For each of the four types of lists in the following table, what is the asymptotic worst-case
running time for each dynamic-set operation listed?
unsorted, singly sorted, singly unsorted, doubly sorted, doubly

MAXIMUM(L)

Problems 10-2: Mergeable heaps using linked lists
A mergeable heap supports the following operations: MAKE-HEAP (which creates an empty
mergeable heap), INSERT, MINIMUM, EXTRACT-MIN, and UNION.[1] Show how to
implement mergeable heaps using linked lists in each of the following cases. Try to make
