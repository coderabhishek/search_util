Sparcstations) running and for recompiling whenever we exceeded a compile-time limit.
Thinking Machines Corporation provided partial support for Charles Leiserson to work on
this book during a leave of absence from MIT.
Many colleagues have used drafts of this text in courses at other schools. They have suggested
numerous corrections and revisions. We particularly wish to thank Richard Beigel, Andrew
Goldberg, Joan Lucas, Mark Overmars, Alan Sherman, and Diane Souvaine.
Many teaching assistants in our courses have made significant contributions to the
development of this material. We especially thank Alan Baratz, Bonnie Berger, Aditi Dhagat,
Burt Kaliski, Arthur Lent, Andrew Moulton, Marios Papaefthymiou, Cindy Phillips, Mark
Reinhold, Phil Rogaway, Flavio Rose, Arie Rudich, Alan Sherman, Cliff Stein, Susmita Sur,
Gregory Troxel, and Margaret Tuttle.
Additional valuable technical assistance was provided by many individuals. Denise Sergent
spent many hours in the MIT libraries researching bibliographic references. Maria Sensale,
the librarian of our reading room, was always cheerful and helpful. Access to Albert Meyer's
personal library saved many hours of library time in preparing the chapter notes. Shlomo
Kipnis, Bill Niehaus, and David Wilson proofread old exercises, developed new ones, and
wrote notes on their solutions. Marios Papaefthymiou and Gregory Troxel contributed to the
indexing. Over the years, our secretaries Inna Radzihovsky, Denise Sergent, Gayle Sherman,
and especially Be Blackburn provided endless support in this project, for which we thank
them.
Many errors in the early drafts were reported by students. We particularly thank Bobby
Blumofe, Bonnie Eisenberg, Raymond Johnson, John Keen, Richard Lethin, Mark Lillibridge,
John Pezaris, Steve Ponzio, and Margaret Tuttle for their careful readings.
Colleagues have also provided critical reviews of specific chapters, or information on specific
algorithms, for which we are grateful. We especially thank Bill Aiello, Alok Aggarwal, Eric
Bach, Vašek Chvátal, Richard Cole, Johan Hastad, Alex Ishii, David Johnson, Joe Kilian,
Dina Kravets, Bruce Maggs, Jim Orlin, James Park, Thane Plambeck, Hershel Safer, Jeff
Shallit, Cliff Stein, Gil Strang, Bob Tarjan, and Paul Wang. Several of our colleagues also
graciously supplied us with problems; we particularly thank Andrew Goldberg, Danny
Sleator, and Umesh Vazirani.
It has been a pleasure working with The MIT Press and McGraw-Hill in the development of
this text. We especially thank Frank Satlow, Terry Ehling, Larry Cohen, and Lorrie Lejeune
of The MIT Press and David Shapiro of McGraw-Hill for their encouragement, support, and
patience. We are particularly grateful to Larry Cohen for his outstanding copyediting.

Acknowledgments for the second edition
When we asked Julie Sussman, P.P.A., to serve as a technical copyeditor for the second
edition, we did not know what a good deal we were getting. In addition to copyediting the
technical content, Julie enthusiastically edited our prose. It is humbling to think of how many
errors Julie found in our earlier drafts, though considering how many errors she found in the
first edition (after it was printed, unfortunately), it is not surprising. Moreover, Julie sacrificed
her own schedule to accommodate ours-she even brought chapters with her on a trip to the
Virgin Islands! Julie, we cannot thank you enough for the amazing job you did.
