Therefore, B-trees can also be used to implement many dynamic-set operations in time O(lg
n).
B-trees generalize binary search trees in a natural manner. Figure 18.1 shows a simple B-tree.
If an internal B-tree node x contains n[x] keys, then x has n[x] + 1 children. The keys in node
x are used as dividing points separating the range of keys handled by x into n[x] + 1
subranges, each handled by one child of x. When searching for a key in a B-tree, we make an
(n[x] + 1)-way decision based on comparisons with the n[x] keys stored at node x. The
structure of leaf nodes differs from that of internal nodes; we will examine these differences
in Section 18.1.

Figure 18.1: A B-tree whose keys are the consonants of English. An internal node x
containing n[x] keys has n[x] + 1 children. All leaves are at the same depth in the tree. The
lightly shaded nodes are examined in a search for the letter R.
Section 18.1 gives a precise definition of B-trees and proves that the height of a B-tree grows
only logarithmically with the number of nodes it contains. Section 18.2 describes how to
search for a key and insert a key into a B-tree, and Section 18.3 discusses deletion. Before
proceeding, however, we need to ask why data structures designed to work on a magnetic disk
are evaluated differently than data structures designed to work in main random-access
memory.
Data structures on secondary storage
There are many different technologies available for providing memory capacity in a computer
system. The primary memory (or main memory) of a computer system normally consists of
silicon memory chips. This technology is typically two orders of magnitude more expensive
per bit stored than magnetic storage technology, such as tapes or disks. Most computer
systems also have secondary storage based on magnetic disks; the amount of such secondary
storage often exceeds the amount of primary memory by at least two orders of magnitude.
Figure 18.2(a) shows a typical disk drive. The drive consists of several platters, which rotate
at a constant speed around a common spindle. The surface of each platter is covered with a
magnetizable material. Each platter is read or written by a head at the end of an arm. The
arms are physically attached, or "ganged" together,and they can move their heads toward or
away from the spindle. When a given head is stationary, the surface that passes underneath it
is called a track. The read/write heads are vertically aligned at all times, and therefore the set
of tracks underneath them are accessed simultaneously. Figure 18.2(b) shows such a set of
tracks, which is known as a cylinder.
