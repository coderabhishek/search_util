Figure 33.9: The operation of Jarvis's march. The first vertex chosen is the lowest point p0.
The next vertex, p1, has the smallest polar angle of any point with respect to p0. Then, p2 has
the smallest polar angle with respect to p1. The right chain goes as high as the highest point
p3. Then, the left chain is constructed by finding smallest polar angles with respect to the
negative x-axis.
We could implement Jarvis's march in one conceptual sweep around the convex hull, that is,
without separately constructing the right and left chains. Such implementations typically keep
track of the angle of the last convex-hull side chosen and require the sequence of angles of
hull sides to be strictly increasing (in the range of 0 to 2π radians). The advantage of
constructing separate chains is that we need not explicitly compute angles; the techniques of
Section 33.1 suffice to compare angles.
If implemented properly, Jarvis's march has a running time of O(nh). For each of the h
vertices of CH(Q), we find the vertex with the minimum polar angle. Each comparison
between polar angles takes O(1) time, using the techniques of Section 33.1. As Section 9.1
shows, we can compute the minimum of n values in O(n) time if each comparison takes O(1)
time. Thus, Jarvis's march takes O(nh) time.
Exercises 33.3-1
Prove that in the procedure GRAHAM-SCAN, points p1 and pm must be vertices of CH(Q).

Exercise 33.3-2
Consider a model of computation that supports addition, comparison, and multiplication and
for which there is a lower bound of Ω(n lg n) to sort n numbers. Prove that Ω(n lg n) is a
lower bound for computing, in order, the vertices of the convex hull of a set of n points in
such a model.
