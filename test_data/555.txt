Intuitively, given a flow network and a flow, the residual network consists of edges that can
admit more flow. More formally, suppose that we have a flow network G = (V, E) with source
s and sink t. Let f be a flow in G, and consider a pair of vertices u, v V. The amount of
additional flow we can push from u to v before exceeding the capacity c(u, v) is the residual
capacity of (u, v), given by
(26.5)
For example, if c(u, v) = 16 and f(u, v) = 11, then we can increase f(u, v) by cf (u, v) = 5 units
before we exceed the capacity constraint on edge (u, v). When the flow f(u, v) is negative, the
residual capacity cf (u, v) is greater than the capacity c(u, v). For example, if c(u, v) = 16 and
f(u, v) = -4, then the residual capacity cf (u, v) is 20. We can interpret this situation as follows.
There is a flow of 4 units from v to u, which we can cancel by pushing a flow of 4 units from
u to v. We can then push another 16 units from u to v before violating the capacity constraint
on edge (u, v). We have thus pushed an additional 20 units of flow, starting with a flow f(u, v)
= -4, before reaching the capacity constraint.
Given a flow network G = (V, E) and a flow f, the residual network of G induced by f is Gf =
(V, Ef), where
Ef = {(u, v)

V × V : cf(u, v) > 0}.

That is, as promised above, each edge of the residual network, or residual edge, can admit a
flow that is greater than 0. Figure 26.3(a) repeats the flow network G and flow f of Figure
26.1(b), and Figure 26.3(b) shows the corresponding residual network Gf.

Figure 26.3: (a) The flow network G and flow f of Figure 26.1(b). (b) The residual network Gf
with augmenting path p shaded; its residual capacity is cf (p) = c(v2, v3) = 4. (c) The flow in G
that results from augmenting along path p by its residual capacity 4. (d) The residual network
induced by the flow in (c).
The edges in Ef are either edges in E or their reversals. If f(u, v) < c(u, v) for an edge (u, v)
E, then cf(u, v) = c(u, v) - f(u, v) > 0 and (u, v) Ef. If f(u, v) > 0 for an edge (u, v) E, then f
(v, u) < 0. In this case, cf(v, u) = c(v, u) - f(v, u) > 0, and so (v, u) Ef. If neither (u, v) nor (v,
u) appears in the original network, then c(u, v) = c(v, u) = 0, f(u, v)> = f(v, u) = 0 (by Exercise
26.1-1), and cf(u, v) = cf(v, u) = 0. We conclude that an edge (u, v) can appear in a residual
network only if at least one of (u, v) and (v, u) appears in the original network, and thus
|Ef| ≤ 2 |E|.
