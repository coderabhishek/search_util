Theorem 31.15: (Lagrange's theorem)
If (S,

) is a finite group and (S′,

) is a subgroup of (S,

), then |S′| is a divisor of |S|.

A subgroup S′ of a group S is said to be a proper subgroup if S′ ≠ S. The following corollary
will be used in our analysis of the Miller-Rabin primality test procedure in Section 31.8.
Corollary 31.16
If S′ is a proper subgroup of a finite group S, then |S′| ≤ |S|/2.

Subgroups generated by an element
Theorem 31.14 provides an interesting way to produce a subgroup of a finite group (S, ):
choose an element a and take all elements that can be generated from a using the group
operation. Specifically, define a(k) for k ≥ 1 by

For example, if we take a = 2 in the group Z6, the sequence a(1), a(2), ...is 2, 4, 0, 2, 4, 0, 2, 4,
0, ... .
In the group Zn, we have a(k) = ka mod n, and in the group , we have a(k) = ak mod n. The
subgroup generated by a, denoted a or ( a , ), is defined by
a

= {a(k) : k ≥ 1}.

We say that a generates the subgroup a or that a is a generator of a . Since S is finite,
a is a finite subset of S, possibly including all of S. Since the associativity of implies
a(i)

a(j) = a(i + j),

a is closed and therefore, by Theorem 31.14,
we have

= {0} ,
= {0,1,2,3,4,5} ,
= {0,2,4} .

Similarly, in

, we have

a
