Combining inequalities (29.1)-(29.3) and (29.5) with the objective of minimizing (29.4), we
obtain what is known as a "linear program." We format this problem as
(29.6)
subject to
(29.7)
(29.8)
(29.9)
(29.10)
The solution of this linear program will yield an optimal strategy for the politician.
General linear programs
In the general linear-programming problem, we wish to optimize a linear function subject to a
set of linear inequalities. Given a set of real numbers a1, a2, ..., an and a set of variables x1, x2,
..., xn, a linear function f on those variables is defined by

If b is a real number and f is a linear function, then the equation
f(x1, x2, ..., xn) = b
is a linear equality and the inequalities
f(x1, x2, ..., xn) ≤ b
and
f(x1, x2, ..., xn) ≥ b
are linear inequalities. We use the term linear constraints to denote either linear equalities or
linear equalities. In linear programming, we do not allow strict inequalities. Formally a
linear-programming problem is the problem of either minimizing or maximizing a linear
function subject to a finite set of linear constraints. If we are to minimize, then we call the
linear program a minimization linear program, and if we are to maximize, then we call the
linear program a maximization linear program.
This remainder of this chapter will cover the formulation and solution of linear programs.
Although there are several polynomial-time algorithms for linear programming, we shall not
study them in this chapter. Instead, we shall study the simplex algorithm, which is the oldest
linear-programming algorithm. The simplex algorithm does not run in polynomial time in the
worst case, but it is fairly efficient and widely used in practice.
