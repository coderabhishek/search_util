It is only for impractically large values of n (greater than A4(1), a huge number) that α(n) > 4,
and so α(n) ≤ 4 for all practical purposes.
Properties of ranks
In the remainder of this section, we prove an O(m α(n)) bound on the running time of the
disjoint-set operations with union by rank and path compression. In order to prove this bound,
we first prove some simple properties of ranks.
Lemma 21.4
For all nodes x, we have rank[x] ≤ rank[p[x]], with strict inequality if x ≠ p[x]. The value of
rank[x] is initially 0 and increases through time until x ≠ p[x]; from then on, rank[x] does not
change. The value of rank[p[x]] monotonically increases over time.
Proof The proof is a straightforward induction on the number of operations, using the
implementations of MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET that appear in Section 21.3. We
leave it as Exercise 21.4-1.

Corollary 21.5
As we follow the path from any node toward a root, the node ranks strictly increase.

Lemma 21.6
Every node has rank at most n - 1.
Proof Each node's rank starts at 0, and it increases only upon LINK operations. Because there
are at most n - 1 UNION operations, there are also at most n - 1 LINK operations. Because
each LINK operation either leaves all ranks alone or increases some node's rank by 1, all
ranks are at most n - 1.

Lemma 21.6 provides a weak bound on ranks. In fact, every node has rank at most ⌊lg n⌋ (see
Exercise 21.4-2). The looser bound of Lemma 21.6 will suffice for our purposes, however.
