b. For a given number K, show that an augmenting path of capacity at least K can be
found in O(E) time, if such a path exists.
The following modification of FORD-FULKERSON-METHOD can be used to compute a
maximum flow in G.

c. Argue that MAX-FLOW-BY-SCALING returns a maximum flow.
d. Show that the capacity of a minimum cut of the residual graph Gf is at most 2K |E|

e. Argue that the inner while loop of lines 5-6 is executed O(E) times for each value of
K.
f. Conclude that MAX-FLOW-BY-SCALING can be implemented so that it runs in
O(E2 lg C) time.

Problem 26-6: Maximum flow with negative capacities
Suppose that we allow a flow network to have negative (as well as positive) edge capacities.
In such a network, a feasible flow need not exist.
a. Consider an edge (u, v) in a flow network G = (V, E) with c(u, v) < 0. Briefly explain
what such a negative capacity means in terms of the flow between u and v.
Let G = (V, E) be a flow network with negative edge capacities, and let s and t be the source
and sink of G. Construct the ordinary flow network G' = (V', E') with capacity function c',
source s', and sink t', where
V' = V

{s', t'}

and
E' = E

{(u, v) : (v, u)
{(s', v) : v V}
{(u, t') : u V}
{(s, t), (t, s)}

E}

We assign capacities to edges as follows. For each edge (u, v)

E, we set
