The order of a (in the group S), denoted ord(a), is defined as the smallest positive integer t
such that a(t) = e.
Theorem 31.17
For any finite group (S, ) and any a S, the order of an element is equal to the size of the
subgroup it generates, or ord(a) = | a |.
Proof Let t = ord(a). Since a(t) = e and a(t+k) = a(t) a(k) = a(k) for k ≥ 1, if i ≥ > t, then a(i)> =
a(j) for some j < i. Thus, no new elements are seen after a(t), so that a = {a(1), a(2), ..., a(t)}
and | a | ≤ t. To show that | a | ≥ t, suppose for the purpose of contradiction that a(i) = a(j)
for some i, j satisfying 1 ≤ i < j ≤ t. Then, a(i+k) = a(j+k) for k ≥ 0. But this implies that a(i+(t - j)) =
a(j+(t - j)) = e, a contradiction, since i + (t - j) < t but t is the least positive value such that a(t) = e.
Therefore, each element of the sequence a(1), a(2), ..., a(t) is distinct, and | a | ≥ t. We
conclude that ord(a) = | a |.

Corollary 31.18
The sequence a(1), a(2), ... is periodic with period t = ord(a); that is, a(i) = a(j) if and only if i ≡ j
(mod t).

It is consistent with the above corollary to define a(0) as e and a(i) as a(i mod t), where t = ord(a),
for all integers i.
Corollary 31.19
If (S,

) is a finite group with identity e, then for all a

S,

a(|S|) = e .
Proof Lagrange's theorem implies that ord(a) | |S|, and so |S| ≡ 0 (mod t), where t = ord(a).
Therefore, a(|S|) = a(0) = e.
