In most of this book, we have found it convenient to think of the elementary arithmetic
operations (multiplications, divisions, or computing remainders) as primitive operations that
take one unit of time. By counting the number of such arithmetic operations that an algorithm
performs, we have a basis for making a reasonable estimate of the algorithm's actual running
time on a computer. Elementary operations can be time-consuming, however, when their
inputs are large. It thus becomes convenient to measure how many bit operations a numbertheoretic algorithm requires. In this model, a multiplication of two β-bit integers by the
ordinary method uses Θ(β2) bit operations. Similarly, the operation of dividing a β-bit integer
by a shorter integer, or the operation of taking the remainder of a β-bit integer when divided
by a shorter integer, can be performed in time Θ(β2) by simple algorithms. (See Exercise 31.111.) Faster methods are known. For example, a simple divide-and-conquer method for
multiplying two β-bit integers has a running time of
, and the fastest known method
has a running time of Θ(β lg β lg lg β). For practical purposes, however, the Θ(β2) algorithm is
often best, and we shall use this bound as a basis for our analyses.
In this chapter, algorithms are generally analyzed in terms of both the number of arithmetic
operations and the number of bit operations they require.

31.1 Elementary number-theoretic notions
This section provides a brief review of notions from elementary number theory concerning the
set Z = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2,..} of integers and the set N = {0, 1, 2, ...} of natural numbers.
Divisibility and divisors
The notion of one integer being divisible by another is a central one in the theory of numbers.
The notation d | a (read "d divides a") means that a = kd for some integer k. Every integer
divides 0. If a > 0 and d | a, then |d| ≤ |a|. If d | a, then we also say that a is a multiple of d. If d
does not divide a, we write d ∤ a.
If d | a and d ≥ 0, we say that d is a divisor of a. Note that d | a if and only if -d | a, so that no
generality is lost by defining the divisors to be nonnegative, with the understanding that the
negative of any divisor of a also divides a. A divisor of an integer a is at least 1 but not
greater than |a|. For example, the divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.
Every integer a is divisible by the trivial divisors 1 and a. Nontrivial divisors of a are also
called factors of a. For example, the factors of 20 are 2, 4, 5, and 10.
Prime and composite numbers
An integer a > 1 whose only divisors are the trivial divisors 1 and a is said to be a prime
number (or, more simply, a prime). Primes have many special properties and play a critical
role in number theory. The first 20 primes, in order, are
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71.
Exercise 31.1-1 asks you to prove that there are infinitely many primes. An integer a > 1 that
is not prime is said to be a composite number (or, more simply, a composite). For example, 39
