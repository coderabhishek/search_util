description of a set of geometric objects, such as a set of points, a set of line segments, or the
vertices of a polygon in counterclockwise order. The output is often a response to a query
about the objects, such as whether any of the lines intersect, or perhaps a new geometric
object, such as the convex hull (smallest enclosing convex polygon) of the set of points.
In this chapter, we look at a few computational-geometry algorithms in two dimensions, that
is, in the plane. Each input object is represented as a set of points {p1, p2, p3, ...}, where each
pi = (xi, yi) and xi, yi R. For example, an n-vertex polygon P is represented by a sequence
p0, p1, p2, ..., pn-1 of its vertices in order of their appearance on the boundary of P.
Computational geometry can also be performed in three dimensions, and even in higherdimensional spaces, but such problems and their solutions can be very difficult to visualize.
Even in two dimensions, however, we can see a good sample of computational-geometry
techniques.
Section 33.1 shows how to answer basic questions about line segments efficiently and
accurately: whether one segment is clockwise or counterclockwise from another that shares an
endpoint, which way we turn when traversing two adjoining line segments, and whether two
line segments intersect. Section 33.2 presents a technique called "sweeping" that we use to
develop an O(n lg n)-time algorithm for determining whether there are any intersections
among a set of n line segments. Section 33.3 gives two "rotational-sweep" algorithms that
compute the convex hull (smallest enclosing convex polygon) of a set of n points: Graham's
scan, which runs in time O(n lg n), and Jarvis's march, which takes O(nh) time, where h is the
number of vertices of the convex hull. Finally, Section 33.4 gives an O(n lg n)-time divideand-conquer algorithm for finding the closest pair of points in a set of n points in the plane.

33.1 Line-segment properties
Several of the computational-geometry algorithms in this chapter will require answers to
questions about the properties of line segments. A convex combination of two distinct points
p1 = (x1, y1) and p2 = (x2, y2) is any point p3 = (x3, y3) such that for some α in the range 0 ≤ α ≤
1, we have x3 = αx1 + (1 - α)x2 and y3 = αy1 + (1 - α)y2. We also write that p3 = αp1 + (1 - α)p2.
Intuitively, p3 is any point that is on the line passing through p1 and p2 and is on or between p1
and p2 on the line. Given two distinct points p1 and p2, the line segment
is the set of

convex combinations of p1 and p2. We call p1 and p2 the endpoints of segment

There are no restrictions on the given points.
We can answer each question in O(1) time, which should come as no surprise since the input
size of each question is O(1). Moreover, our methods will use only additions, subtractions,
multiplications, and comparisons. We need neither division nor trigonometric functions, both
