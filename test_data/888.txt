b. There are n coins, with an arbitrary number of different denominations, but each
denomination is a nonnegative integer power of 2, i.e., the possible denominations are
1 dollar, 2 dollars, 4 dollars, etc. They wish to divide the money exactly evenly.
c. There are n checks, which are, in an amazing coincidence, made out to "Bonnie or
Clyde." They wish to divide the checks so that they each get the exact same amount of
money.
d. There are n checks as in part (c), but this time they are willing to accept a split in
which the difference is no larger than 100 dollars.

Problems 34-3: Graph coloring
A k-coloring of an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a function c : V → {1, 2,..., k} such that
c(u) ≠ c(v) for every edge (u, v) E. In other words, the numbers 1, 2,..., k represent the k
colors, and adjacent vertices must have different colors. The graph-coloring problem is to
determine the minimum number of colors needed to color a given graph.
a. Give an efficient algorithm to determine a 2-coloring of a graph if one exists.
b. Cast the graph-coloring problem as a decision problem. Show that your decision
problem is solvable in polynomial time if and only if the graph-coloring problem is
solvable in polynomial time.
c. Let the language 3-COLOR be the set of graphs that can be 3-colored. Show that if 3COLOR is NP-complete, then your decision problem from part (b) is NP-complete.
To prove that 3-COLOR is NP-complete, we use a reduction from 3-CNF-SAT. Given a
formula φ of m clauses on n variables x1, x2,..., xn, we construct a graph G = (V, E) as follows.
The set V consists of a vertex for each variable, a vertex for the negation of each variable, 5
vertices for each clause, and 3 special vertices: TRUE, FALSE, and RED. The edges of the
graph are of two types: "literal" edges that are independent of the clauses and "clause" edges
that depend on the clauses. The literal edges form a triangle on the special vertices and also
form a triangle on xi, ¬xi, and RED for i = 1, 2,..., n.
d. Argue that in any 3-coloring c of a graph containing the literal edges, exactly one of a
variable and its negation is colored c(TRUE) and the other is colored c(FALSE).
Argue that for any truth assignment for φ, there is a 3-coloring of the graph containing
just the literal edges.
The widget shown in Figure 34.20 is used to enforce the condition corresponding to a clause
(x y z). Each clause requires a unique copy of the 5 vertices that are heavily shaded in the
figure; they connect as shown to the literals of the clause and the special vertex TRUE.
e. Argue that if each of x, y, and z is colored c(TRUE) or c(FALSE), then the widget is 3colorable if and only if at least one of x, y, or z is colored c(TRUE).
f. Complete the proof that 3-COLOR is NP-complete.
