Proof Suppose that a matrix A is singular. Then by Corollary 28.3, there exists a nonzero
vector x such that Ax = 0. Hence, xT Ax = 0, and A cannot be positive-definite.

The proof that we can perform LU decomposition on a symmetric positive-definite matrix A
without dividing by 0 is more involved. We begin by proving properties about certain
submatrices of A. Define the kth leading submatrix of A to be the matrix Ak consisting of the
intersection of the first k rows and first k columns of A.
Lemma 28.10
If A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix, then every leading submatrix of A is symmetric
and positive-definite.
Proof That each leading submatrix Ak is symmetric is obvious. To prove that Ak is positivedefinite, we assume that it is not and derive a contradiction. If Ak is not positive-definite, then
there exists a size-k vector xk ≠ 0 such that
. Letting A be n × n, we define the size-n
vector
, where there are n - k 0's following xk. Then we have

which contradicts A being positive-definite.

We now turn to some essential properties of the Schur complement. Let A be a symmetric
positive-definite matrix, and let Ak be a leading k × k submatrix of A. Partition A as
(28.28)
We generalize definition (28.23) to define the Schur complement of A with respect to Ak as
(28.29)
(By Lemma 28.10, Ak is symmetric and positive-definite; therefore,
exists by Lemma 28.9,
and S is well defined.) Note that our earlier definition (28.23) of the Schur complement is
consistent with definition (28.29), by letting k = 1.
