f(n) = O(g(n)) ≈ a ≤ b,
f(n) = Ω(g(n)) ≈ a ≥ b,
f(n) = Θ(g(n)) ≈ a = b,
f(n) = o(g(n)) ≈ a < b,
f(n) = ω(g(n)) ≈ a > b.
We say that f(n) is asymptotically smaller than g(n) if f(n) = o(g(n)), and f(n) is
asymptotically larger than g(n) if f(n) = ω(g(n)).
One property of real numbers, however, does not carry over to asymptotic notation:
•

Trichotomy: For any two real numbers a and b, exactly one of the following must
hold: a < b, a = b, or a > b.

Although any two real numbers can be compared, not all functions are asymptotically
comparable. That is, for two functions f(n) and g(n), it may be the case that neither f(n) =
O(g(n)) nor f(n) = Ω(g(n)) holds. For example, the functions n and n1+sin n cannot be compared
using asymptotic notation, since the value of the exponent in n1+sin n oscillates between 0 and
2, taking on all values in between.

Let f(n) and g(n) be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic definition of Θnotation, prove that max(f(n), g(n)) = Θ(f(n) + g(n)).

Explain why the statement, "The running time of algorithm A is at least O(n2)," is
meaningless.
