for i = 1, 2, . . . , m and k = 1, 2, . . . , p. The procedure MATRIX-MULTIPLY in Section 25.1
implements matrix multiplication in the straightforward manner based on equation (28.3),
assuming that the matrices are square: m = n = p. To multiply n × n matrices, MATRIXMULTIPLY performs n3 multiplications and n2(n - 1) additions, and so its running time is
Θ(n3).
Matrices have many (but not all) of the algebraic properties typical of numbers. Identity
matrices are identities for matrix multiplication:
Im A = AIn = A
for any m × n matrix A. Multiplying by a zero matrix gives a zero matrix:
A 0 = 0.
Matrix multiplication is associative:
(28.4)
for compatible matrices A, B, and C. Matrix multiplication distributes over addition:
(28.5)

For n > 1, multiplication of n × n matrices is not commutative. For example, if

and

, then

and

Matrix-vector products or vector-vector products are defined as if the vector were the
equivalent n × 1 matrix (or a 1 × n matrix, in the case of a row vector). Thus, if A is an m × n
matrix and x is a vector of size n, then Ax is a vector of size m. If x and y are vectors of size n,
then

is a number (actually a 1 × 1 matrix) called the inner product of x and y. The matrix xyT is an
n×n matrix Z called the outer product of x and y, with zij = xi yj. The (euclidean) norm x
of a vector x of size n is defined by
x
