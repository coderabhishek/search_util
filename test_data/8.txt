The second edition was produced in
. Michael Downes converted the
macros from
"classic"
to
, and he converted the text files to use these new macros. David Jones
support. Figures for the second edition were produced by the authors
also provided
using MacDraw Pro. As in the first edition, the index was compiled using Windex, a C
program written by the authors, and the bibliography was prepared using
. Ayorkor
Mills-Tettey and Rob Leathern helped convert the figures to MacDraw Pro, and Ayorkor also
checked our bibliography.
As it was in the first edition, working with The MIT Press and McGraw-Hill has been a
delight. Our editors, Bob Prior of The MIT Press and Betsy Jones of McGraw-Hill, put up
with our antics and kept us going with carrots and sticks.
Finally, we thank our wives-Nicole Cormen, Gail Rivest, and Rebecca Ivry-our childrenRicky, William, and Debby Leiserson; Alex and Christopher Rivest; and Molly, Noah, and
Benjamin Stein-and our parents-Renee and Perry Cormen, Jean and Mark Leiserson, Shirley
and Lloyd Rivest, and Irene and Ira Stein-for their love and support during the writing of this
book. The patience and encouragement of our families made this project possible. We
affectionately dedicate this book to them.
