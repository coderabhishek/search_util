Computing the expected number of probes for a successful search requires a little more work.
Theorem 11.8
Given an open-address hash table with load factor Î± < 1, the expected number of probes in a
successful search is at most

assuming uniform hashing and assuming that each key in the table is equally likely to be
searched for.
Proof A search for a key k follows the same probe sequence as was followed when the
element with key k was inserted. By Corollary 11.7, if k was the (i + 1)st key inserted into the
hash table, the expected number of probes made in a search for k is at most 1/(1 - i/m) = m/(m
- i). Averaging over all n keys in the hash table gives us the average number of probes in a
successful search:

where
is the ith harmonic number (as defined in equation (A.7)). Using the
technique of bounding a summation by an integral, as described in Section A.2, we obtain

for a bound on the expected number of probes in a successful search.

If the hash table is half full, the expected number of probes in a successful search is less than
1.387. If the hash table is 90 percent full, the expected number of probes is less than 2.559.
