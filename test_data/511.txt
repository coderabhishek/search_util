One solution to this problem is x = (-5, -3, 0, -1, -4), as can be verified directly by checking
each inequality. In fact, there is more than one solution to this problem. Another is x' = (0, 2,
5, 4, 1). These two solutions are related: each component of x' is 5 larger than the
corresponding component of x. This fact is not mere coincidence.
Lemma 24.8
Let x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) be a solution to a system Ax ≤ b of difference constraints, and let d be
any constant. Then x + d = (x1 + d, x2 + d,..., xn + d) is a solution to Ax ≤ b as well.
Proof For each xi and xj , we have (xj + d) - (xi + d) = xj - xi . Thus, if x satisfies Ax ≤ b, so
does x + d.

Systems of difference constraints occur in many different applications. For example, the
unknowns xi may be times at which events are to occur. Each constraint can be viewed as
stating that there must be at least a certain amount of time, or at most a certain amount of
time, between two events. Perhaps the events are jobs to be performed during the assembly of
a product. If we apply an adhesive that takes 2 hours to set at time x1 and we have to wait until
it sets to install a part at time x2, then we have the constraint that x2 ≥ x1 + 2 or, equivalently,
that x1 - x2 ≤ -2. Alternatively, we might require that the part be installed after the adhesive
has been applied but no later than the time that the adhesive has set halfway. In this case, we
get the pair of constraints x2 ≥ x1 and x2 ≤ x1 + 1 or, equivalently, x1 - x2 ≤ 0 and x2 - x1 ≤ 1.
Constraint graphs
It is beneficial to interpret systems of difference constraints from a graph-theoretic point of
view. The idea is that in a system Ax ≤ b of difference constraints, the m × n linearprogramming matrix A can be viewed as the transpose of an incidence matrix (see Exercise
22.1-7) for a graph with n vertices and m edges. Each vertex vi in the graph, for i = 1, 2,..., n,
corresponds to one of the n unknown variables xi . Each directed edge in the graph
corresponds to one of the m inequalities involving two unknowns.
More formally, given a system Ax ≤ b of difference constraints, the corresponding constraint
graph is a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E), where
V = {v0, v1,..., vn}
and
E = {(vi, vj) : xj - xi ≤ bk is a constraint}

{(v0, v1), (v0, v2), (v0, v3),..., (v0, vn)} .

The additional vertex v0 is incorporated, as we shall see shortly, to guarantee that every other
vertex is reachable from it. Thus, the vertex set V consists of a vertex vi for each unknown xi ,
plus an additional vertex v0. The edge set E contains an edge for each difference constraint,
plus an edge (v0, vi) for each unknown xi . If xj - xi ≤ bk is a difference constraint, then the
