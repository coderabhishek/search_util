Figure 18.2: (a) A typical disk drive. It is composed of several platters that rotate around a
spindle. Each platter is read and written with a head at the end of an arm. The arms are ganged
together so that they move their heads in unison. Here, the arms rotate around a common
pivot axis. A track is the surface that passes beneath the read/write head when it is stationary.
(b) A cylinder consists of a set of covertical tracks.
Although disks are cheaper and have higher capacity than main memory, they are much,
much slower because they have moving parts. There are two components to the mechanical
motion: platter rotation and arm movement. As of this writing, commodity disks rotate at
speeds of 5400–15,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), with 7200 RPM being the most
common. Although 7200 RPM may seem fast, one rotation takes 8.33 milliseconds, which is
almost 5 orders of magnitude longer than the 100 nanosecond access times commonly found
for silicon memory. In other words, if we have to wait a full rotation for a particular item to
come under the read/write head, we could access main memory almost 100,000 times during
that span! On average we have to wait for only half a rotation, but still, the difference in
access times for silicon memory vs. disks is enormous. Moving the arms also takes some
time. As of this writing, average access times for commodity disks are in the range of 3 to 9
milliseconds.
In order to amortize the time spent waiting for mechanical movements, disks access not just
one item but several at a time. Information is divided into a number of equal-sized pages of
bits that appear consecutively within cylinders, and each disk read or write is of one or more
entire pages. For a typical disk, a page might be 211 to 214 bytes in length. Once the read/write
head is positioned correctly and the disk has rotated to the beginning of the desired page,
reading or writing a magnetic disk is entirely electronic (aside from the rotation of the disk),
and large amounts of data can be read or written quickly.
Often, it takes more time to access a page of information and read it from a disk than it takes
for the computer to examine all the information read. For this reason, in this chapter we shall
look separately at the two principal components of the running time:
•
•

the number of disk accesses, and
the CPU (computing) time.

The number of disk accesses is measured in terms of the number of pages of information that
need to be read from or written to the disk. We note that disk access time is not constant—it
depends on the distance between the current track and the desired track and also on the initial
rotational state of the disk. We shall nonetheless use the number of pages read or written as a
first-order approximation of the total time spent accessing the disk.
