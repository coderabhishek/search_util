The left side of the above equation is the expectation of the sum of n random variables. By
Lemma 5.1, we can easily compute the expectation of each of the random variables. By
equation (C.20)-linearity of expectation-it is easy to compute the expectation of the sum: it
equals the sum of the expectations of the n random variables. Linearity of expectation makes
the use of indicator random variables a powerful analytical technique; it applies even when
there is dependence among the random variables. We now can easily compute the expected
number of heads:

Thus, compared to the method used in equation (C.36), indicator random variables greatly
simplify the calculation. We shall use indicator random variables throughout this book.
Analysis of the hiring problem using indicator random variables
Returning to the hiring problem, we now wish to compute the expected number of times that
we hire a new office assistant. In order to use a probabilistic analysis, we assume that the
candidates arrive in a random order, as discussed in the previous section. (We shall see in
Section 5.3 how to remove this assumption.) Let X be the random variable whose value equals
the number of times we hire a new office assistant. We could then apply the definition of
expected value from equation (C.19) to obtain

but this calculation would be cumbersome. We shall instead use indicator random variables to
greatly simplify the calculation.
To use indicator random variables, instead of computing E[X] by defining one variable
associated with the number of times we hire a new office assistant, we define n variables
related to whether or not each particular candidate is hired. In particular, we let Xi be the
indicator random variable associated with the event in which the ith candidate is hired. Thus,
(5.2)
and
(5.3)
By Lemma 5.1, we have that
