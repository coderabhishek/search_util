Exercises 5.4-3:
For the analysis of the birthday paradox, is it important that the birthdays be mutually
independent, or is pairwise independence sufficient? Justify your answer.

Exercises 5.4-4:
How many people should be invited to a party in order to make it likely that there are three
people with the same birthday?

Exercises 5.4-5:
What is the probability that a k-string over a set of size n is actually a k-permutation? How
does this question relate to the birthday paradox?

Exercises 5.4-6:
Suppose that n balls are tossed into n bins, where each toss is independent and the ball is
equally likely to end up in any bin. What is the expected number of empty bins? What is the
expected number of bins with exactly one ball?

Exercises 5.4-7:
Sharpen the lower bound on streak length by showing that in n flips of a fair coin, the
probability is less than 1/n that no streak longer than lg n-2 lg lg n consecutive heads occurs.

Problems 5-1: Probabilistic counting
With a b-bit counter, we can ordinarily only count up to 2b - 1. With R. Morris's probabilistic
counting, we can count up to a much larger value at the expense of some loss of precision.
