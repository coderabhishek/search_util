us to focus on their operation for input sequences consisting solely of 0's and 1's. Once we
have constructed a sorting network and proved that it can sort all zero-one sequences, we shall
appeal to the zero-one principle to show that it properly sorts sequences of arbitrary values.
The proof of the zero-one principle relies on the notion of a monotonically increasing function
(Section 3.2).
Lemma 27.1
If a comparison network transforms the input sequence a = a1, a2,...,an into the output
sequence b = b1, b2,...,bn , then for any monotonically increasing function f, the network
transforms the input sequence f (a) = f(a1), f(a2),...,f(an) into the output sequence f(b) =
f(b1), f(b2),...,f(bn) .
Proof We shall first prove the claim that if f is a monotonically increasing function, then a
single comparator with inputs f(x) and f(y) produces outputs f(min(x, y)) and f(max(x, y)). We
then use induction to prove the lemma.
To prove the claim, consider a comparator whose input values are x and y. The upper output
of the comparator is min(x, y) and the lower output is max(x, y). Suppose we now apply f(x)
and f(y) to the inputs of the comparator, as is shown in Figure 27.4. The operation of the
comparator yields the value min(f(x), f(y)) on the upper output and the value max(f(x), f(y)) on
the lower output. Since f is monotonically increasing, x ≤ y implies f(x) ≤ f(y). Consequently,
we have the identities
min(f(x), f(y)) = f(max(x, y)),
max(f(x), f(y)) = f(min(x, y)).

Figure 27.4: The operation of the comparator in the proof of Lemma 27.1. The function f is
monotonically increasing.
Thus, the comparator produces the values f(min(x, y)) and f(max(x, y)) when f(x) and f(y) are
its inputs, which completes the proof of the claim.
We can use induction on the depth of each wire in a general comparison network to prove a
stronger result than the statement of the lemma: if a wire assumes the value ai when the input
sequence a is applied to the network, then it assumes the value f(ai) when the input sequence
f(a) is applied. Because the output wires are included in this statement, proving it will prove
the lemma.
For the basis, consider a wire at depth 0, that is, an input wire ai. The result follows trivially:
when f(a) is applied to the network, the input wire carries f(ai). For the inductive step,
consider a wire at depth d, where d ≥ 1. The wire is the output of a comparator at depth d, and
the input wires to this comparator are at a depth strictly less than d. By the inductive
hypothesis, therefore, if the input wires to the comparator carry values ai and aj when the
input sequence a is applied, then they carry f(ai) and f(aj) when the input sequence f(a) is
applied. By our earlier claim, the output wires of this comparator then carry f(min(ai, aj)) and
