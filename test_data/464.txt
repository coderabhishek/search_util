Exercises 22.3-4
Show that edge (u, v) is
1. a tree edge or forward edge if and only if d[u] < d[v] < f[v] < f[u],
2. a back edge if and only if d[v] < d[u] < f[u] < f[v], and
3. a cross edge if and only if d[v] < f[v] < d[u] < f[u].

Exercises 22.3-5
Show that in an undirected graph, classifying an edge (u, v) as a tree edge or a back edge
according to whether (u, v) or (v, u) is encountered first during the depth-first search is
equivalent to classifying it according to the priority of types in the classification scheme.

Exercises 22.3-6
Rewrite the procedure DFS, using a stack to eliminate recursion.

Exercises 22.3-7
Give a counterexample to the conjecture that if there is a path from u to v in a directed graph
G, and if d[u] < d[v] in a depth-first search of G, then v is a descendant of u in the depth-first
forest produced.

Exercises 22.3-8
Give a counterexample to the conjecture that if there is a path from u to v in a directed graph
G, then any depth-first search must result in d[v] â‰¤ f[u].
