The following lemma and its corollary complete the analysis. They use the in-equality
(proved in Exercise 3.2-7)
Fk+2 ≥ φk,
where φ is the golden ratio, defined in equation (3.22) as

.

Lemma 20.3
Let x be any node in a Fibonacci heap, and let k = degree[x]. Then, size(x) ≥ Fk+2 ≥ φk, where
.
Proof Let sk denote the minimum possible value of size(z) over all nodes z such that degree[z]
= k. Trivially, s0 = 1, s1 = 2, and s2 = 3. The number sk is at most size(x), and clearly, the value
of sk increases monotonically with k. As in Lemma 20.1, let y1, y2, . . . , yk denote the children
of x in the order in which they were linked to x. To compute a lower bound on size(x), we
count one for x itself and one for the first child y1 (for which size(y1) ≥ 1), giving

where the last line follows from Lemma 20.1 (so that degree[yi] ≥ i - 2) and the monotonicity
of sk (so that sdegree [yi] ≥ si-2).
We now show by induction on k that sk ≥ Fk+2 for all nonnegative integer k. The bases, for k =
0 and k = 1, are trivial. For the inductive step, we assume that k ≥ 2 and that si ≥ Fi+2 for i = 0,
1, . . . , k - 1. We have
