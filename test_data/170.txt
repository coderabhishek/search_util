Problems 9-1: Largest i numbers in sorted order
Given a set of n numbers, we wish to find the i largest in sorted order using a comparisonbased algorithm. Find the algorithm that implements each of the following methods with the
best asymptotic worst-case running time, and analyze the running times of the algorithms in
terms of n and i.
a. Sort the numbers, and list the i largest.
b. Build a max-priority queue from the numbers, and call EXTRACT-MAX i times.
c. Use an order-statistic algorithm to find the ith largest number, partition around that
number, and sort the i largest numbers.

Problems 9-2: Weighted median
For n distinct elements x1, x2, ..., xn with positive weights w1, w2, ..., wn such that
weighted (lower) median is the element xk satisfying

, the

and

a. Argue that the median of x1, x2, ..., xn is the weighted median of the xi with weights wi
= 1/n for i = 1,2, ..., n.
b. Show how to compute the weighted median of n elements in O(n lg n) worst-case time
using sorting.
