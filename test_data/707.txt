then and are optimal solutions to the primal and dual linear programs, respectively.
Proof By Lemma 29.8, the objective value of a feasible solution to the primal cannot exceed
that of a feasible solution to the dual. The primal linear program is a maximization problem
and the dual is a minimization problem. Thus, if feasible solutions and have the same
objective value, neither can be improved.

Before proving that there always is a dual solution whose value is equal to that of an optimal
primal solution, we describe how to find such a solution. When we ran the simplex algorithm
on the linear program in (29.56)–(29.60), the final iteration yielded the slack form (29.75)–
(29.78) with B = {1, 2, 4} and N = {3, 5, 6}. As we shall show below, the basic solution
associated with the final slack form is an optimal solution to the linear program; an optimal
solution to linear program (29.56)–(29.60) is therefore
, with objective value
(3 · 8) + (1 · 4) + (2 · 0) = 28. As we shall also show below, we can read off an optimal dual
solution: the negatives of the coefficients of the primal objective function are the values of the
dual variables. More precisely, suppose that the last slack form of the primal is

Then an optimal dual solution is to set
(29.94)
Thus, an optimal solution to the dual linear program defined in (29.89)–(29.93) is
(since
n + 1 = 4 B),
, and
. Evaluating the dual objective function
(29.89), we obtain an objective value of (30 · 0) + (24 · (1/6)) + (36 · (2/3)) = 28, which
confirms that the objective value of the primal is indeed equal to the objective value of the
dual. Combining these calculations with Lemma 29.8, we have a proof that the optimal
objective value of the primal linear program is 28. We now show that in general, an optimal
solution to the dual, and a proof of the optimality of a solution to the primal, can be obtained
in this manner.
Theorem 29.10: (Linear-programming duality)
Suppose that SIMPLEX returns values
on the primal linear program (A, b, c).
Let N and B denote the nonbasic and basic variables for the final slack form, let c′ denote the
coefficients in the final slack form, and let
be defined by equation (29.94). Then

program, and
