31.3 Modular arithmetic
Informally, we can think of modular arithmetic as arithmetic as usual over the integers, except
that if we are working modulo n, then every result x is replaced by the element of {0, 1, ..., n 1} that is equivalent to x, modulo n (that is, x is replaced by x mod n). This informal model is
sufficient if we stick to the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. A more
formal model for modular arithmetic, which we now give, is best described within the
framework of group theory.
Finite groups
A group (S, ) is a set S together with a binary operation
following properties hold.

defined on S for which the

1. Closure: For all a, b S, we have a b S.
2. Identity: There is an element e S, called the identity of the group, such that e a =
a e = a for all a S.
3. Associativity: For all a, b, c S, we have (a b) c = a (b c).
4. Inverses: For each a S, there exists a unique element b S, called the inverse of a,
such that a b = b a = e.
As an example, consider the familiar group (Z, +) of the integers Z under the operation of
addition: 0 is the identity, and the inverse of a is -a. If a group (S, ) satisfies the
commutative law a b = b a for all a, b S, then it is an abelian group. If a group S, )
satisfies |S| < ∞, then it is a finite group.
The groups defined by modular addition and multiplication
We can form two finite abelian groups by using addition and multiplication modulo n, where
n is a positive integer. These groups are based on the equivalence classes of the integers
modulo n, defined in Section 31.1.
To define a group on Zn, we need to have suitable binary operations, which we obtain by
redefining the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication. It is easy to define addition
and multiplication operations for Zn, because the equivalence class of two integers uniquely
determines the equivalence class of their sum or product. That is, if a ≡ a′ (mod n) and b ≡ b′
(mod n), then
a + b ≡ a′ + b′ (mod n) ,
ab ≡ a′b′ (mod n) .
Thus, we define addition and multiplication modulo n, denoted +n and ·n, as follows:
(31.18)
(Subtraction can be similarly defined on Zn by [a]n -n [b]n = [a-b]n, but division is more
complicated, as we shall see.) These facts justify the common and convenient practice of
using the least nonnegative element of each equivalence class as its representative when
