the primal. For example, consider the linear program given in (29.56)–(29.60). The dual of
this linear program is

(29.91)
(29.92)
(29.93)
We will show, in Theorem 29.10, that the optimal value of the dual linear program is always
equal to the optimal value of the primal linear program. Further-more, the simplex algorithm
actually implicitly solves both the primal and the dual linear programs simultaneously,
thereby providing a proof of optimality.
We begin by demonstrating weak duality, which states that any feasible solution to the primal
linear program has a value no greater than that of any feasible solution to the dual linear
program.
Lemma 29.8: (Weak linear-programming duality
Let be any feasible solution to the primal linear program in (29.16)–(29.18) and let be any
feasible solution to the dual linear program in (29.86)–(29.88). Then

Proof We have

Corollary 29.9
Let be a feasible solution to a primal linear program (A, b, c), and let be a feasible solution
to the corresponding dual linear program. If
