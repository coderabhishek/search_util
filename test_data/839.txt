will shoot a stream at his chosen ghost. As we all know, it is very dangerous to let streams
cross, and so the Ghostbusters must choose pairings for which no streams will cross.
Assume that the position of each Ghostbuster and each ghost is a fixed point in the plane and
that no three positions are collinear.
a. Argue that there exists a line passing through one Ghostbuster and one ghost such the
number of Ghostbusters on one side of the line equals the number of ghosts on the
same side. Describe how to find such a line in O(n lg n) time.
b. Give an O(n2 lg n)-time algorithm to pair Ghostbusters with ghosts in such a way that
no streams cross.

Problems 33-4: Picking up sticks
Professor Charon has a set of n sticks, which are lying on top of each other in some
configuration. Each stick is specified by its endpoints, and each endpoint is an ordered triple
giving its (x, y, z) coordinates. No stick is vertical. He wishes to pick up all the sticks, one at a
time, subject to the condition that he may pick up a stick only if there is no other stick on top
of it.
a. Give a procedure that takes two sticks a and b and reports whether a is above, below,
or unrelated to b.
b. Describe an efficient algorithm that determines whether it is possible to pick up all the
sticks, and if so, provides a legal sequence of stick pickups to do so.

Problems 33-5: Sparse-hulled distributions
Consider the problem of computing the convex hull of a set of points in the plane that have
been drawn according to some known random distribution. Sometimes, the number of points,
or size, of the convex hull of n points drawn from such a distribution has expectation O(n1- )
for some constant > 0. We call such a distribution sparse-hulled. Sparse-hulled
distributions include the following:
•
•
•

Points drawn uniformly from a unit-radius disk. The convex hull has Θ(n1/3) expected
size.
Points drawn uniformly from the interior of a convex polygon with k sides, for any
constant k. The convex hull has Θ(lg n) expected size.
Points drawn according to a two-dimensional normal distribution. The convex hull has
expected size.

a. Given two convex polygons with n1 and n2 vertices respectively, show how to
compute the convex hull of all n1 + n2 points in O(n1 + n2) time. (The polygons may
overlap.)
