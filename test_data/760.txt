implies ax ≡ 1 (mod n). Thus, we can compute (a-1 mod n) efficiently using EXTENDEDEUCLID.
Exercises 31.4-1
Find all solutions to the equation 35x ≡ 10 (mod 50).

Exercises 31.4-2
Prove that the equation ax ≡ ay (mod n) implies x ≡ y (mod n) whenever gcd(a, n) = 1. Show
that the condition gcd(a, n) = 1 is necessary by supplying a counterexample with gcd(a, n) >
1.

Exercises 31.4-3
Consider the following change to line 3 of the procedure MODULAR-LINEAR-EQUATIONSOLVER:
3 then x0 ← x′(b/d) mod (n/d)

Will this work? Explain why or why not.
Exercises 31.4-4:
Let f(x) ≡ f0 + f1x + ··· + ft xt (mod p) be a polynomial of degree t, with coefficients fi drawn
from Zp, where p is prime. We say that a Zp is a zero of f if f(a) ≡ 0 (mod p). Prove that if a
is a zero of f, then f(x) ≡ (x - a)g(x) (mod p) for some polynomial g(x) of degree t - 1. Prove by
induction on t that a polynomial f(x) of degree t can have at most t distinct zeros modulo a
prime p.

31.5 The Chinese remainder theorem
Around A.D. 100, the Chinese mathematician Sun-Tsu solved the problem of finding those
integers x that leave remainders 2, 3, and 2 when divided by 3, 5, and 7 respectively. One such
solution is x = 23; all solutions are of the form 23 + 105k for arbitrary integers k. The
"Chinese remainder theorem" provides a correspondence between a system of equations
modulo a set of pairwise relatively prime moduli (for example, 3, 5, and 7) and an equation
modulo their product (for example, 105).
