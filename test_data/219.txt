Problems 11-4: k-universal hashing and authentication

Let ℋ = {h} be a class of hash functions in which each h maps the universe U of keys to {0,
1, ..., m - 1}. We say that ℋ is k-universal if, for every fixed sequence of k distinct keys
x(1), x(2), ..., x(k) and for any h chosen at random from ℋ, the sequence h(x(1)), h(x(2)), ...,
h(x(k)) is equally likely to be any of the mk sequences of length k with elements drawn from
{0, 1, ..., m - 1}.
a. Show that if ℋ is 2-universal, then it is universal.
b. Let U be the set of n-tuples of values drawn from Zp, and let B = Zp, where p is prime.
For any n-tuple a = a0, a1, ..., an-1 of values from Zp and for any b Zp, define the
hash function ha,b : U → B on an input n-tuple x = x0, x1, ..., xn-1 from U as

and let ℋ = {ha,b}. Argue that ℋ is 2-universal.
c. Suppose that Alice and Bob agree secretly on a hash function ha,b from a 2-universal
family ℋ of hash functions. Later, Alice sends a message m to Bob over the Internet,
where m U . She authenticates this message to Bob by also sending an
authentication tag t = ha,b(m), and Bob checks that the pair (m, t) he receives satisfies t
= ha,b(m). Suppose that an adversary intercepts (m, t) en route and tries to fool Bob by
replacing the pair with a different pair (m', t'). Argue that the probability that the
adversary succeeds in fooling Bob into accepting (m', t') is at most 1/p, no matter how
much computing power the adversary has.

[1]

When nj = mj = 1, we don't really need a hash function for slot j; when we Choose a hash
function ha,b(k) = ((ak + b) mod p) mod mj for such a slot, we just use a = b = 0.

Chapter notes
Knuth [185] and Gonnet [126] are excellent references for the analysis of hashing algorithms.
Knuth credits H. P. Luhn (1953) for inventing hash tables, along with the chaining method for
resolving collisions. At about the same time, G. M. Amdahl originated the idea of open
addressing.
