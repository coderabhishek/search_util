Exercises 26.4-1
Show how to implement the generic push-relabel algorithm using O(V) time per relabel
operation, O(1) time per push, and O(1) time to select an applicable operation, for a total time
of O(V2E).

Exercises 26.4-2
Prove that the generic push-relabel algorithm spends a total of only O(V E) time in performing
all the O(V2) relabel operations.

Exercises 26.4-3
Suppose that a maximum flow has been found in a flow network G = (V, E) using a pushrelabel algorithm. Give a fast algorithm to find a minimum cut in G.

Exercises 26.4-4
Give an efficient push-relabel algorithm to find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph.
Analyze your algorithm.

Exercises 26.4-5
Suppose that all edge capacities in a flow network G = (V, E) are in the set {1, 2, . . . , k}.
Analyze the running time of the generic push-relabel algorithm in terms of |V|, |E|, and k.
(Hint: How many times can each edge support a nonsaturating push before it becomes
saturated?)
