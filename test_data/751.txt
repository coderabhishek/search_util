performing computations in Zn. Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are performed as
usual on the representatives, but each result x is replaced by the representative of its class (that
is, by x mod n).
Using this definition of addition modulo n, we define the additive group modulo n as (Zn, +n).
This size of the additive group modulo n is |Zn| = n. Figure 31.2(a) gives the operation table
for the group (Z6, +6).

Theorem 31.12
The system (Zn, +n) is a finite abelian group.
Proof Equation (31.18) shows that (Zn, +n) is closed. Associativity and commutativity of +n
follow from the associativity and commutativity of +:
([a]n +n[b]n) +n [c]n = [a + b]n +n[c]n
= [(a + b) + c]n
= [a + (b + c)]n
= [a]n +n [b + c]n
= [a]n +n ([b]n +n [c]n),
[a]n +n [b]n = [a + b]n
= [b + a]n
= [b]n +n [a]n.
The identity element of (Zn, +n) is 0 (that is, [0]n). The (additive) inverse of an element a (that
is, of [a]n) is the element -a (that is, [-a]n or [n - a]n), since [a]n +n [-a]n = [a - a]n = [0]n.

Using the definition of multiplication modulo n, we define the multiplicative group modulo n
as (
). The elements of this group are the set of elements in Zn that are relatively prime to
n:
