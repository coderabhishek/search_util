spent performing relabel operations, and Lemma 26.23 provides an O(VE) bound on the total
number of saturating push operations.
Theorem 26.31
The running time of RELABEL-TO-FRONT on any flow network G = (V, E) is O(V3).
Proof Let us consider a "phase" of the relabel-to-front algorithm to be the time between two
consecutive relabel operations. There are O(V2) phases, since there are O(V2) relabel
operations. Each phase consists of at most |V| calls to DISCHARGE, which can be seen as
follows. If DISCHARGE does not perform a re-label operation, then the next call to
DISCHARGE is further down the list L, and the length of L is less than |V|. If DISCHARGE
does perform a relabel, the next call to DISCHARGE belongs to a different phase. Since each
phase contains at most |V| calls to DISCHARGE and there are O(V2) phases, the number of
times DISCHARGE is called in line 8 of RELABEL-TO-FRONT is O(V3). Thus, the total
work performed by the while loop in RELABEL-TO-FRONT, excluding the work performed
within DISCHARGE, is at most O(V3).
We must now bound the work performed within DISCHARGE during the execution of the
algorithm. Each iteration of the while loop within DISCHARGE performs one of three
actions. We shall analyze the total amount of work involved in performing each of these
actions.
We start with relabel operations (lines 4-5). Exercise 26.4-2 provides an O(VE) time bound on
all the O(V2) relabels that are performed.
Now, suppose that the action updates the current[u] pointer in line 8. This action occurs
O(degree(u) times each time a vertex u is relabeled, and O(V Â· degree(u)) times overall for the
vertex. For all vertices, therefore, the total amount of work done in advancing pointers in
neighbor lists is O(VE) by the handshaking lemma (Exercise B.4-1).
The third type of action performed by DISCHARGE is a push operation (line 7). We already
know that the total number of saturating push operations is O(VE). Observe that if a
nonsaturating push is executed, DISCHARGE immediately returns, since the push reduces the
excess to 0. Thus, there can be at most one nonsaturating push per call to DISCHARGE. As
we have observed, DISCHARGE is called O(V3) times, and thus the total time spent
performing nonsaturating pushes is O(V3).
The running time of RELABEL-TO-FRONT is therefore O(V3 + VE), which is O(V3).

Exercises 26.5-1
Illustrate the execution of RELABEL-TO-FRONT in the manner of Figure 26.10 for the flow
network in Figure 26.1(a). Assume that the initial ordering of vertices in L is v1, v2, v3, v4
and that the neighbor lists are
