Exercises 34.3-1
Verify that the circuit in Figure 34.8(b) is unsatisfiable.

Exercises 34.3-2
Show that the ≤P relation is a transitive relation on languages. That is, show that if L1 ≤P L2
and L2 ≤P L3, then L1 ≤P L3.

Exercises 34.3-3

.

Exercises 34.3-4
Show that a satisfying assignment can be used as a certificate in an alternative proof of
Lemma 34.5. Which certificate makes for an easier proof?

Exercises 34.3-5
The proof of Lemma 34.6 assumes that the working storage for algorithm A occupies a
contiguous region of polynomial size. Where in the proof is this assumption exploited? Argue
that this assumption does not involve any loss of generality.

Exercises 34.3-6
A language L is complete for a language class C with respect to polynomial-time reductions if
L C and L′ ≤P L for all L′ C. Show that Ø and {0,1}* are the only languages in P that are
not complete for P with respect to polynomial-time reductions.
