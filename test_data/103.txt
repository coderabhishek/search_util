exclusive, independent coin flips, the probability that every one of these groups fails to be a
streak of length ⌊(lg n)/2⌋ is at most

For this argument, we used inequality (3.11), 1 + x ≤ ex , and the fact, which you might want
to verify, that
for sufficiently large n.
Thus, the probability that the longest streak exceeds ⌊(lg n)/2⌋ is
(5.12)

We can now calculate a lower bound on the expected length of the longest streak, beginning
with equation (5.11) and proceeding in a manner similar to our analysis of the upper bound:

As with the birthday paradox, we can obtain a simpler but approximate analysis using
indicator random variables. We let Xik = I{Aik} be the indicator random variable associated
with a streak of heads of length at least k beginning with the ith coin flip. To count the total
number of such streaks, we define

Taking expectations and using linearity of expectation, we have
