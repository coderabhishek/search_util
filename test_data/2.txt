Preface
This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of computer
algorithms. It presents many algorithms and covers them in considerable depth, yet makes
their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. We have tried to keep
explanations elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.
Each chapter presents an algorithm, a design technique, an application area, or a related topic.
Algorithms are described in English and in a "pseudocode" designed to be readable by anyone
who has done a little programming. The book contains over 230 figures illustrating how the
algorithms work. Since we emphasize efficiency as a design criterion, we include careful
analyses of the running times of all our algorithms.
The text is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate courses in algorithms or
data structures. Because it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design, as well as
mathematical aspects, it is equally well suited for self-study by technical professionals.
In this, the second edition, we have updated the entire book. The changes range from the
addition of new chapters to the rewriting of individual sentences.

To the teacher
This book is designed to be both versatile and complete. You will find it useful for a variety
of courses, from an undergraduate course in data structures up through a graduate course in
algorithms. Because we have provided considerably more material than can fit in a typical
one-term course, you should think of the book as a "buffet" or "smorgasbord" from which you
can pick and choose the material that best supports the course you wish to teach.
You should find it easy to organize your course around just the chapters you need. We have
made chapters relatively self-contained, so that you need not worry about an unexpected and
unnecessary dependence of one chapter on another. Each chapter presents the easier material
first and the more difficult material later, with section boundaries marking natural stopping
points. In an undergraduate course, you might use only the earlier sections from a chapter; in
a graduate course, you might cover the entire chapter.
We have included over 920 exercises and over 140 problems. Each section ends with
exercises, and each chapter ends with problems. The exercises are generally short questions
that test basic mastery of the material. Some are simple self-check thought exercises, whereas
others are more substantial and are suitable as assigned homework. The problems are more
elaborate case studies that often introduce new material; they typically consist of several
questions that lead the student through the steps required to arrive at a solution.
We have starred (⋆) the sections and exercises that are more suitable for graduate students
than for undergraduates. A starred section is not necessarily more difficult than an unstarred
